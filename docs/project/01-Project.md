# Initial ideas

##Project at-a-glance

**Problem - What is your fight or problem?**
Reducing gender violence by promoting healthy masculinities, helping couples establish emotional regulation and exploring ways to tackle problems at the root (prevention, working with younger populations).

**Specific aspects of the problem - In what ways can we tackle the problem to mitigate it or solve it at the root?**
Work with women to empower them financially, work with men to nurture positive masculinities, work with children to tackle problems at the root.

**Communities to engage with - What users or communities can we collaborate with to solve the problem?**
Couples, children (teenagers or younger), all-men communities, women in vulnerable situations.

**Weak signals - What signals relate to your fight?**
Non-heteropatriarchal innovation, tech for equality, emotional design, redesigning habits, wellness tech, economies of care, inclusivity activism, productive domestic space.

**Outcome - What impact do we want to see in the world as a result of this?**
Couples with better communication, fathers teaching positive masculinities to their children, empowered women, new generations with new lenses regarding positive masculinities.

**Success - How do we imagine success, by when and how will we measure it? (metrics)**
Depends on chosen community - but some metrics could be - increased number of new honest conversations in couples, better distribution of income or management of income in women, increased dialogues around toxic and positive masculinities in younger generations.

**Outputs & Milestones - What tangible or intangible deliverables or interventions will I ship and when?**
- **Ongoing communications stream** to keep key players and collaborators in the loop -- (i) Updated notion with all the repository, biweekly newsletter with over 100 subscribers, landing site for built products (in progress)
- **A series of interventions** - 1) co-creating with children in public spaces and academic institutions 2) detecting gender bias in synthetic realities, 4) using AI chatbot for healing from IPV (work-in-progress)
