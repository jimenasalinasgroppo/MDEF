# Prototyping for Design - Trimester 3

##Day 1 - Robots
During this class we were introduced to the topic of robots, specifically looking at robotic arms. I was sick for this session but looking through the class documentation what stood out for me was xxxxxx.

I also played around with the Rhino plug in to see the simulation of the robot arm.

One of the questions this module sparked for me was how can we introduce robots to solutions to human problems and beyond engineering and manufacturing?

##Day 2 - Introduction to Blender
During this session Victor introduced us to the software of Blender. I had previously used Blender for a prototyping for design challenge but was unaware of many of its benefits and also did not know that it is open source.

We were introduced in depth to its history, the concept of software libre and open and how the product has evolved in the past years.
