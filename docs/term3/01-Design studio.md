# Design Studio

## Outlining my first intervention for the Third Trimester

For this third trimester I would like to focus on the Perception Board workshop I have been working with Ariel and Wen, while in parallel running small experiments.

The reason is because I feel there is still a design opportunity to figure out how the Perception board would work in context with children 13 years and older while also incorporating other elements to our system and session such as the Speaker Mic. We are also interested in designing a promotional landing site to pitch the project to other organisations that might be interested in collaborating with us. I feel I could also link it to the theme of gender equality by designing a session fully focused on that subject and then testing with a different community.

In parallel, I would also like to work with Carolina to explore ecofeminism from a different angle.

This is our first draft of the workshop we are planning to run with students as part of MDEFest.
