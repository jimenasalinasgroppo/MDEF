# Design Ethics

##Day 1
In this class, the teacher discussed various topics related to naturalism, technology, design, and systems thinking. They highlighted how technology has become an inherent part of our existence and how it is not neutral but carries underlying values and ethics. The idea of "design is ethics by other means" was introduced, emphasizing how design choices can reflect the ethical values of those who create them. The concept of the iceberg model was also discussed, which suggests that what we see on the surface is only a small part of a larger system, and that there are underlying layers that relate to different things. Overall, this class emphasized the importance of understanding the assumptions and values that underlie the technology we use, and the ethical implications of design choices in our increasingly technological world.
