# Design Ethics

##Day 1
In this class, the teacher discussed various topics related to naturalism, technology, design, and systems thinking. Ariel highlighted how technology has become an inherent part of our existence and how it is not neutral but carries underlying values and ethics. The idea of "design is ethics by other means" was introduced, emphasizing how design choices can reflect the ethical values of those who create them. The concept of the iceberg model was also discussed, which suggests that what we see on the surface is only a small part of a larger system, and that there are underlying layers that relate to different things. Overall, this class emphasized the importance of understanding the assumptions and values that underlie the technology we use, and the ethical implications of design choices in our increasingly technological world.

In this class, we explored the idea of technological neutrality and how it can be a reductive way of looking at technology. For instance, the saying "games don't kill people, people kill people" oversimplifies the complex role that technology can play in shaping our behavior and experiences. We discussed how even something as seemingly neutral as a gun can have a profound impact on the situation and the people involved. When someone holds a gun, they become a hybrid of sorts, a person with a weapon that defines what is possible within the situation. This discussion challenged us to think more critically about the role of technology in our lives and the ethical implications of our design choices.
