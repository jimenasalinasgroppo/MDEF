# MDEFest

##Day 1 - Intro to MDEFest
During this first session we were introduced to what is MDEFest and what events that sit within MDEF can look like. I was pleasantly surprised to see FemFabrik being mentioned as a reference since this was the event me and Carolina participated to exhibit our ecofeminist collages designed with Mam√°s que Leen.

Me, Wen and Ariel plan to work together for MDEFest since we want to push our Perception Board further and run an interactive workshop with children, co-creating with private schools.
