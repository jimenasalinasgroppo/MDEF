# MDEFest

##Week 1 Day 1 - Intro to MDEFest
During this first session we were introduced to what is MDEFest and what events that sit within MDEF can look like. I was pleasantly surprised to see FemFabrik being mentioned as a reference since this was the event me and Carolina participated to exhibit our ecofeminist collages designed with Mam√°s que Leen.

Me, Wen and Ariel plan to work together for MDEFest since we want to push our Perception Board further and run an interactive workshop with children, co-creating with private schools.

##Week 1 Day 2 - Mapping stakeholders
For this session we mapped out collectively the stakeholders we should engage with and the level of involvement for each.

We also deep dived on a concept festival. Me, Wen and Ariel came up with the concept of "Little Big Futures", a festival that targets children's perceptions of the future mainly in schools in Barcelona but that can also evolve to public exhibits in open spaces.

In this Miro board you can find our first draft.

##Week 2 Day 1 - Defining an umbrella
In this session the importance of defining locations and my team collaborated with Marc, Ahmed and Caglar under the Education umbrella. They wanted to focus on crafts and maker education while our focus is on defining futures with children.

##Week 2 Day 2 - Finding common themes and spheres
Today we collectively used a Miro board to find topics in common, synthesize and also look for patterns across the projects the whole class is working on. My project with Carolina around ecofeminism fit under Nature and Craft umbrellas while my project with Wen and Ariel fits under Education sphere.

##Week 4 Day 1 - Brainstorming a common name
During this session we ideated as a collective on potential names for MDEFest around the concept of the body and futures. "No body knows" was the winning title, focusing on the Monster and individual body parts relevant to each of the interventions.

##Week 4 Day 2 - Choosing a Name
During this session we collectively chose a winning name "No body knows the future" and did a voting session for the specific body parts. We also started drafting a table were we deep dived on the specifics for my MDEFest intervention with Wen and Ariel.

##Week 5 Day 1 - Comms and Design Brief
During this session we did a branding and communication exercise to think of the visual brand and look and feel for "No body knows the future". We also came up with the caption "Fantastic quimeras of the future". It is exciting to see how MDEFest is taking shape and starting to look like a collective effort.

##Week 5 Day 1 - Comms and Design Brief
AS a group, we voted on the branding proposals made by Manu. One was more tech-focused and AI-driven and the other more hand-drawn illustrated. The voting proposal was the tech/AI-driven one. Me, Wen and Ariel will think of how to make it more attractive for children and school teachers.

##Production With Jana
We worked closely with Jana to define our production requirements to hit the ground running. We had pretty simple production needs since the school would provide the location and the students. We only used 17 euros in Copiservei A2 prints.
