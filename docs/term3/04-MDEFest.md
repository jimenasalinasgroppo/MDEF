# MDEFest

##Week 1 Day 1 - Intro to MDEFest
During this first session we were introduced to what is MDEFest and what events that sit within MDEF can look like. I was pleasantly surprised to see FemFabrik being mentioned as a reference since this was the event me and Carolina participated to exhibit our ecofeminist collages designed with Mam√°s que Leen.

Me, Wen and Ariel plan to work together for MDEFest since we want to push our Perception Board further and run an interactive workshop with children, co-creating with private schools.

##Week 1 Day 2 - Mapping stakeholders
For this session we mapped out collectively the stakeholders we should engage with and the level of involvement for each.

We also deep dived on a concept festival. Me, Wen and Ariel came up with the concept of "Little Big Futures", a festival that targets children's perceptions of the future mainly in schools in Barcelona but that can also evolve to public exhibits in open spaces.

In this Miro board you can find our first draft.

##Week 2 Day 1 - Defining an umbrella
In this session the importance of defining locations and my team collaborated with Marc, Ahmed and Caglar under the Education umbrella. They wanted to focus on crafts and maker education while our focus is on defining futures with children.

##Week 2 Day 2 - Finding common themes and spheres
Today we collectively used a Miro board to find topics in common, synthesize and also look for patterns across the projects the whole class is working on. My project with Carolina around ecofeminism fit under Nature and Craft umbrellas while my project with Wen and Ariel fits under Education sphere.
