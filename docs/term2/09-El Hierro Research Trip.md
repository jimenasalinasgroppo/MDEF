# El Hierro Research Trip
This week at El Hierro has been inspiring to learn about sustainability, circularity, rural futures and hyperlocal production. Javier was an amazing guide, showing us his approach to a well-rounded life beyond seeking profit and growth. Experimenting locally and co-fabricating with nature and humans in El Hierro allowed us to gain a fresh perspective on new ways to engage as designers.

##Video - “Como es arriba, es abajo”

For the video submission, I was particularly interested in capturing and documenting ceilings and floors. I felt this are perspectives that we usually don’t see when walking or talking to people and conceptually it was also interesting to see what the sky and the earth could communicate just by staring at the images and shapes made by light, nature and shadows.

For the first video iteration I learned to make reels on my cellphone with the help of Wen and found that it is a powerful communication tool. I chose a vertical mobile format since it highlighted the upper and lower parts (ceilings and floors). For the second iteration I added sounds I had captured on my personal Zoom recorder of the local people we had spoken to to add a human element to the non-human footage.

We spend so much of our time moving through the world in a linear way, always looking straight ahead. But what happens when we shift our focus upwards and downwards? When we take the time to look up and down, we open ourselves up to a whole new world of possibilities and perspectives.

In this project, we explore the spaces above and below us, the ceilings and floors that frame our daily lives. The ceiling, often overlooked, is a canvas for architectural and artistic expression. It can be simple and unadorned, or it can be a work of art in its own right. By looking up, we can appreciate the beauty and creativity that goes into the design of these spaces.

On the other hand, the ground beneath our feet can be just as interesting and inspiring. We walk on it every day without really noticing it, but there is so much beauty to be found in the textures and patterns of the ground. Whether it's the smooth marble of a city sidewalk or the rough stones of a natural pathway, the ground can be a canvas for artistic expression as well.

As we move through our daily lives, we rarely take the time to appreciate the spaces above and below us. But by doing so, we gain a new perspective on the world around us. We see the intricate details and patterns that we might have missed before. We also begin to appreciate the importance of the spaces we occupy and the role they play in shaping our experiences.

So let us take the time to look up and down, to appreciate the ceilings and floors that surround us. Let us explore the textures and patterns of the ground beneath our feet and the artistic expression of the ceilings above us. By doing so, we open ourselves up to a whole new world of possibilities and perspectives.
