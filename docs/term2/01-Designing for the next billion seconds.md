# Designing for the next billion seconds

This week was a journey in questioning my notions of linear time, my relationship with the environment and a way to nurture my curiosity in new books. The importance of embracing the future with “Critical hope” is the most important takeaway for me as optimism is something I have lately left out of my design practice and “degrowth” is another new concept that was introduced to me. The narratives of GDP growing as measures of success are not sustainable from a planetary perspective and we need to start designing narratives that stay away from greed, addiction and the myth of unlimited human wants.

## Below are the three takeaways I mapped out during class:

1. The importance of moving beyond user-centricity to planetary wellbeing. I have previously worked using user-centricity as the norm and the new “religion” in corporate environments. But user-centricity is highly flawed when you only design for one individual, the one with purchasing power and disregard how that will affect the rest of the ecosystem involved. Examples such as Rappi in Latin America leading to workers without any form of rights and dignified salaries and Airbnb gentrifying neighborhoods and not allowing for locals to live near to their workplaces.

2. Rethinking tech companies as data extraction centers and beginning to monitor how my relationship with them influences my day-to-day life. Changing my cell phone screen to black and white is a first step in this direction.

3. Looking at climate change as a symptom and redesign processes looking at root causes. Thirdly, one important reflection that arose from this week is how can we begin to dig deeper into the root causes of societal problems and be critical of how they relate to consumerism, capitalism and our nocive ways of relating with our planet.

# Assignments

**A Day in My Post Technological Life**

For this exercise I learned that nature (even if I can’t tell in my everyday life) plays an important role in my perception of a desirable future. I aspire for more peace and mental clarity and fulfillment rather than overstimulation through consumption and digital screens.

**Group Assignment - Time capsule**

For the group assignment we spent a whole day walking from Cosmocaixa Museum back to IAAC and taking photographs of things in the city that caught your attention. It was an interesting way to engage with the city and we even walked past Marc’s school. While I feel we interpreted the assignment too photographically, using the images we took as an only prompt was an interesting forcing function to imagine as a group what the future would look like.

**Letter from your future self**

> Transcript:
Dear younger self,
Do not rush to find answers to the questions of what you want to do with this next chapter of  your life. “Live the questions now”, like Rilke said, for life experiences are waiting to happen in the future but focus on the ones happening today, in your present. They have been designed for this unique moment in your journey and will most likely not repeat themselves in this particular moment in linear time.
What you are learning today about designing a better future is exactly what you needed to hear to pursue those passion projects that will evolve to become larger than yourself. But first be patient and close your eyes. The present is always the most beautiful moment in linear time.
Also, remember there are no straight lines in nature and so there are no straight paths in liFe. You will fail and you will fall, and you will rise back up again but do not fear those moments of failure because they will lead you where you need to be.
But where can you find those answers to the questions you are looking for now? Go to nature, design with nature and think of the design principles of nature and ways you can bring that back to the challenges of the future.
You are doing ok.
I love you, always, in linear and non-linear time.
- Your “you of the future”
