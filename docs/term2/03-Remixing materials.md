# Remixing materials

This week we deep dived on remixing materials with a particular point of view on growing materials from nature (such as mycelium) and using waste for designing with circularity. One of the highlights for me was the possibility of using waste as input and then mixing the process with other tools such as 3D printing or using moulds to create new objects.

Remixing materials is an important part of achieving a more sustainable, circular economy. Remixing materials also allows us to create innovative new materials from existing organic and waste materials. This helps to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacturing new materials from scratch. Remixing materials can also help to create more affordable, custom-made products, reducing the cost of goods and making them more accessible to everyone. Furthermore, remixing materials can enable more creative and sustainable design solutions, allowing designers to find new and innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment.

# Our material exploration: Remixing orange perfectly

During the following classes we became familiarized with moulding, 3D printing and ways to create our own moulds. I was very inspired by ways you can create reproductionns of your own products just by creating your own moulds and not necessarily relying on a 3D printer.

Me, Ariel and Wen decided to experiment with orange peel during the second week as a means to explore new material applications and the possibility of building a compostable product. We were inspired by all the orange peel leftovers from the "Zumos de Naranjas" consumed during breakfast in Barcelona and self-served in stores and supermarkets such as Mercadona. One of our initial questions we asked was: What if the vase that contained the orange juice was made out of peel instead of plastic?
