# Prototyping For Design

## Week 1 - Day 1

Today Victor told us about microchips and the specific parts behind it. The highlight for me was learning that there were layers of communication that could be closest to the hardware and therefore most technical and then there were others that are closest to the user and therefore more accessible to humans, such as the chat prompts of GPT-3.

###**Micro challenge 1** Learning to activate music with a buzzer using our electronic kit.

## Week 1 - Day 2

Today Eduardo taught us more about modelling and 3D models. He started by introducing terminology such as pixels vs vectors and going to basics allowed all of us to start with a clear mind.

One of the technical highlights for me was learning the importance of reducing image file sizes when uploading them to a website and being mindful of the ecological impact of not doing this.

###**Micro challenge 2.1** Parametrizing a croissant

I asked Chat GPT3 to parametrize a croissant since I have zero experience with modeling and 3D software besides 3Ds max when I was doing an animation class on product advertising.

###**Micro challenge 2.2** Create a 3D design based on algorithmic thinking of any object or concept you like.

This was very exciting for me because I have zero experience modelling but the tools are very accesible.
