# Measuring The World
Measuring the world seminar was very hands-on to begin to comprehend data capturing processes, the intentions behind them and how a scientific hypotheses based approach is a way to understand data.

There is a two-pronged approach to utilizing data, collecting it as an individual or working with data collected by others. There was an interesting discussion about chat GPT 3 and Amazon turk, understanding forms of digital slavery. To me, the content was particularly interesting because I've always wanted to scrape for news headlines looking for gender violence, inspired by the work of MIT's data+feminism lab.
