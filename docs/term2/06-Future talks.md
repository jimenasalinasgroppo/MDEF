# Future talks

## General reflections

Reflection will go here.

## Audrey Desjardins

Audrey Desjardins shared how she implemented first person perspective using autoethnography from a lens of academia. My main takeaway from this session is the importance of documenting and in many formats (such as DIY tutorials, travel diaries and time lapse videos). The other highlight for me is embracing subjectivity and getting co-conspirators in your process. Subjectivity always exist so it is best to embrace it rather than hiding it and pretending it doesn't exist. Audrey shared her experience living in a van and how she adapted this journey as her autobiographical intervention.

More than the research topic, I was also interested in the conversation afterwards when she shared an article on how design research can sometimes act as psychotherapy. I have seen this happen in conversations with survivors of violence in relationships and in corporate settings and sometimes a design reserch interview can act as a safe space for victims to speak up. However researchers are not always trained to manage or handle these conversations so this is something important to keep in mind when engaging with humans and addressing taboo topics.

Another important point the conversation raised was made by Marielle about the priviledge of picking a theme such as travelling in a van as Academia and it got me thinking of how culture and in which part of the world you are designing influences the urgency of your subject matter and allows you to focus more on the future. When designing in Peru and Latin America urgency and the present is always at the forefront and the future and the planet is secondary. This is not something to be judged but something to be understood.

## Laura Forlano

Building on the subject of first person perspective, we heard the work of Laura Forlano who is very interested in cyborgs and how cyborgs emerge in society. Her work also explores the intersections between disability and cybords and she had very good examples of working with the diabetes community. One thing that was a highlight for me was how she deep dived on Reddit communities and how communities can also occur in the digital space, especially when people need to come together around a medical condition or a disability and may have trouble finding peers in their geographical region.

A tool that I will try to incorporate in my work moving forward are **vignettes**. Trying to capture specific or unique moments that resonate with you personally that can then become design input. She mentioned that when a key moment occurs she takes notes, writes basic details to jog her memory and then writes up the vignette to make sense of the story. Some stylist examples, writing vignettes as diary entries, i.e. "it was 5:03 am when ..."
