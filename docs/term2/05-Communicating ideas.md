# Communicating Ideas

Our first session with Kate was very energizing and a good way to take a moment to think of the ways we are not only communicating our projects but our individual fights and our political points of view as designers. One of the highlights in this session was double clicking on language, the diversity of languages found globally and how respecting and honoring the multiculturality of language is important and key.
