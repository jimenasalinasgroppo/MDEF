# Design studio - Second Trimester

> Assignment: Reflect on your and your project’s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called “failures” as opportunities for redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project accordingly.

#How has my project evolved?

During the first trimester, I set out to map the gender / innovation / tech ecosystem in Barcelona, gather a community interested in deep diving on these subjects and conducting short and quick experiments both individually and collectively to identify connections both from a subject matter perspective to connecting with other peers in MDEF.

After the first trimester I had 3 theories of change I wanted to deep dive further in:

- **What if we imagined an automated chatbot that heals violent relationships and trauma?**
I learned that healing using GPT3 can sit within ethical borders and it is best to use this technology for actual conversations that will indeed happen in the future. ie. Helping someone practice for a break-up conversation, using chat as a means to teach people about non-violent communication. These are 2 areas I will deep dive in this second trimester.**
What if we actively fought gender bias and harassment through machine generated imagery and words? For this one, I wrote a medium article and shared it on my newsletter. While I feel it is a great opportunity area, I feel generating feminist data sets will be a bit too time-consuming considering the time frames of the Master so will put this one on hold.
- **What if we co-created future visions on gender equality with children?** I will run a workshop with 75 9-year old children in a school in Badalona with Ariel and Wen. The objective is to use these imagined futures as a means to work towards those goals for the rest of my interventions.

#Arising opportunity areas:

**What if we co-created future visions on ecofeminism with migrant women?** This can shift power balance, allow them to discovery their voices and be an introduction towards developing a futures literacy muscle.

**What if we taught non-violent communication through micro digital stories for children?**

##New project goals

While I feel my area of interest and weak signals have not changed, process-wise I am learning to flow more freely and let myself be swept away by potential collaborations that may emerge even if they don’t fit precisely into my original ideas. I also plan on using interventions as a way to gain insights rather than as a means to designing a final product or service.

The interventions for the following month are as follows:

1. **Deep dive on collage-creation workshop with Ariel and Wen**
My intention in this intervention is used the end results imagined by children as starting points for my experiments for a final project. What futures do children imagine in relation to gender equality and ecofeminism?
2. **Intervention with Carolina on futures literacy with migrant women.**
We intend to give voice to women in vulnerable situations through a collage exercise to capture ancestral knowledge and think of ways of documenting beyond texts and verbal language.
3. **Personal project - Online open-source glossary on gender-related terminology and/or micro digital storybooks to teach children Non-Violent Communication**
4. **Personal project - AI chatbot to help men and women navigate difficult conversations**
Iteration of Innerbot (from first trimester) and content curated by a Non Violent Communication expert.

**Some scripts to explore:**
- Rehearsing a couples’ negotiation

- Talking about couple finances

- Women asking for a raise

- Simulating a break up

- Helping fathers have healthy communication with their children

For pushing this project forward my next steps will be contacting Taller Estampa for technical help and playing with chat GPT3 to emulate the scenarios. After having an initial prototype, I will seek the aid of a Nonviolent Communication expert and a GBV expert.
