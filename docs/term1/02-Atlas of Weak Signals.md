# Atlas of Weak Signals

![](../images/MT01/designspace.jpg)

My main weak signals are Non-heteropatriarchal innovation and Technology for equality. I feel technology can be a powerful tool and ally in helping disrupt gender roles and achieving equality if used correctly. I would love to use MDEF as a means to further explore how emergent technologies can be used to serve this purpose. My previous background experience merges human-centered design and agile methodologies to create digital products at the service of creating new ventures (ie. Colectivo23) and new social programs to combat Intimate Partner Violence (ie. Hablemos Entre Patas). I am interested in merging human-centered methodologies and using evidence-based approaches to achieving change at scale. In Peru and Latin America violence against women is increasingly normalized. On the other hand, investment in technology looks at digitally transforming massive corporations that lean towards monopolies whilst social and urgent problems go unnoticed and underfunded. My passion is to merge the learnings of user-centricity, agility and technology at the service of creating a more gender equal world.

At the present moment innovation needs to also tackle societal problems so ingrained and normalized in our social fabric as is violence against women in its multiple forms. I am curious to explore how experiments and prototypes can be conducted in prevention programs and also in other manifestations of gender violence that sit at the lowest part of the iceberg of violence that sometimes go unnoticed, such as stereotypes and sexist humor.
