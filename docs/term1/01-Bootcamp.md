# Bootcamp

What is my fight?

This week has been an incredible starting point to begin to comprehend the way MDEF works, the collaborative networks that exist between IAAC and Elisava with other organizations in Poblenou and  Barcelona and the mindsets required to thrive in the program.

Collaboration does not only occur on a surface level or a physical level with buildings situated right next to each other, but also occurs at a team level and at a discipline level. While being exposed to new neighborhoods, colleagues, collaboration models and learning more about Barcelona, we were also tasked with learning how to set up our Github accounts and understand the logic behind git. These parallel streams have coexisted to provide us with an understanding of what is to come and also build excitement for the possibilities of expanding our design craft.
