# Living with your own ideas

## My (non-living) companion

![](../images/MT01/companion.jpg)

**Family totem**
The “family totem” is my response to finding myself physically distanced from my family.

- **how will you live together?**
I will make a special shrine or dedicated space in my living room for it to be placed when I am not out and about. Whenever I leave my house, I will take it with me inside my purpose but allowing for its eyes (2 bottle caps)  to look into the outside world.
- **what does it notice?**
The family totem notices my emotions whenever I miss my family and can tune into them and distract me by asking me to “feed it”, “decorate it” or just stare at it while thinking of my loved ones.
- **what were you thinking?**
While building it I was thinking of a way to reconnect with my family. Initially I was planning on creating some sort of viewfinder that could allow me to browse through pictures of them, then it evolved into some sort of “doll” I could care for as a replacement. I now believe its more of a symbolic totem that I should place in a special place to honor their place in my life.
- **why does it matter?**
The family totem matters because it helped me reflect that rather than “replacing” who you miss it is best to honor the space they occupy. I think the fact that the totem is big in size and not as portable is a good example of this reflection. Another reflection I had while building the totem is that adding eyes or an outfit to it allowed me to create a stronger emotional connection with it. If I focused on perceiving it as “cute”, it helped bring me joy and turn a negative emotion into something more positive or at least nostalgic in a constructive manner.

**Evaluation**

After spending a whole day with the family totem, I realized due to its size that it is very difficult to carry because of its size. It almost feels like a “weight” one needs to let go of for being able to handle daily tasks. This made me reflect how nostalgia or sadness sometimes needs its own space and time to not interrupt with daily life. It is also highly noticeable for others and seems more like something I would want to keep in a private space.

For the second half of the day, I dedicated a special space for the Totem in my living room. This seemed more suitable as I could devote dedicated minutes to staring at it and forcefully thinking of my family back in Peru. One quick reflection I had was related to private / public spaces and where the companion seems to accomplish its objective more meaningfully. Thinking about materiality, if I were to rebuild or iterate this prototype I would use something more durable and polished. Something I like about the Totem is that it allows you to reminisce in a more free and abstract manner without literally looking at a photograph, which at times can take you to a very specific time and place.

##First person perspective: Quantifying household chores

I wanted to explore a way to quantify household chores using time as a unit of measure and recording myself cleaning my apartment using the slowest mechanism possible (i.e. using a broom as opposed to a vacuum cleaner, hand washing dishes as opposed to using a dishwasher and hand washing my clothes as opposed to using a washing machine). I wanted to explore gender roles, considering that an unequal division of household chores usually contributes to gender inequality.

What does it mean to clean without technology today? How can cleaning without technology evidence the value and time involved in this type of unpaid labor? How can quantifying the time involved in cleaning help with distribution of household chores?

Women typically spend disproportionately more time on unpaid care work than men. How can we reinforce the value in cleaning? How can we design public policies for unpaid labor? A time saving device it creates more space to fill with more work in  other fields?
