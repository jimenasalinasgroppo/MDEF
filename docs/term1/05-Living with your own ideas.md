# Living with your own ideas

## My companion

The last two weeks were focused on Bio Zero and we had two remote Agri sessions during the final week. It was really mind blowing for me to learn about biology intersecting with design and biomaterial creation. Learning about biohackers and their relation with the cyber punk movement was incredibly inspiring as making biology accessible and DIY is one of the first steps towards empowerment and decentralizing knowledge across fields. With a personal background in social sciences and communications, I had never made my own bioplastics before and while doing the experiment with my group it was very humbling to initially get the measurements wrong but then fix the situation collectively. We were awed by what you can make in your own kitchen and how you can start experimenting with new bioplastics at home with materials you can purchase locally and hassle-free.

After these two weeks I am inspired by the potential of combining the discipline of design with biology, especially as it can correlate with public policy, new material creation and circular economy and more sustainable ways of inhabiting planet Earth. As designers, we learn how to experiment in a maybe less organized and systematic way than in the fields of scientific research. One takeaway I get is learning to journal and write everything down with as much precision and rigurosity as possible. This is especially useful when analyzing results and coming up with conclusions. Peer reviews and collaboration in scientific papers also make me wonder how that can be translated to the design space with the same rigurosity and spirit of systematic new knowledge creation.
