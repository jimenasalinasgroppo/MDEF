My passion is to design solutions that empower and unlock opportunities for underserved demographics. My dream is to devote my professional life to solving inequalities, challenging structural gaps through design and storytelling. I have focused my career on helping new education ventures and cultural transformation projects thrive by leading and participating in cross-disciplinary design projects. But these methodologies have gaps, when a solid research base is not present and when leaders are not committed to questioning the status quo. Seven years into this journey, I have realized the importance of complementing the human-centered design methodology with insights that take into account the complex nuances of structural inequality. The pandemic hit Latin America, widening disparities and reversing progress. My goal is to help overcome these setbacks and secure an even brighter future for the upcoming generations. My bold hypothesis is that ventures need compelling narratives intentionally designed to solve structural inequality. I still have to acquire deeper knowledge in research and prototyping and I want to expand my network to collaborate with like-minded professionals and subject matter experts to solve some of these problems.

Lina is very well-connected with the queer community in Barcelona and helped me sharing names of potential NGOs and organizations I could initially reach out to. While some of them did not reply back, I did some desktop research to understand what these initiatives did, what their approach was, what communities they chose to tackle and what their theory of change was. I was able to have conversations with Petra from Shemakes, Flor from Femi\u00f1etas, Ismael from Sexus and Paco from Loba Project. These conversations were very energizing but also intimidating to find out there is so much already being done in this territory in Barcelona. I also went to a conference organized by Plural, a center for masculinities funded by the Ayuntamiento of Barcelona. This is my attempt to sketch out the ecosystem I have identified. This is not comprehensive but gives you some ideas of what it looks like. Activity 1 - Attending a masculinities workshop for Catalan Youth \u00b6 I also attended a 5 session workshop for Catalan youth that revolved around masculinities. I was the only foreigner in the room but everyone was very welcoming. The group was half men and half women, mostly in their early twenties. Women that were attending were there for research purposes (university projects or because they work in psychology fields) while men had more open agendas just being willing to learn and access free education. Ismael, the workshop lead, was very good at creating an atmosphere of reflection and a safe space for everyone to talk about their prejudices, previous preconceptions and future reflections in this subject matter. It felt a very safe space to talk about subjects such as pornography, sexuality and romantic love. Intervention 2 - Signing up for an all-women pointillism class at La Madriguera in Eixample \u00b6 I am very interested in illustration and pursue illustration as a side project. Part of the reason I chose Barcelona as a destination for my Master\u2019s degree is because of La Madriguera. La Madriguera is Paula Bonet\u2019s project where women meet to explore and play with art, illustration and engraving. A month ago I enrolled in a pointillism class with LaLauri, a Spanish artist I admire very much. My goal was to go back to drawing without an iPad, playing with my hands and understanding the role space and community played in these types of workshops. It was great to find out that many women had traveled from other regions of Spain to join the workshop in Barcelona. The structure of the workshop was highly focused on practical tools and exercises to play around and let go of expectations. The end results were incredible as with simple tips and tricks, Laura managed to get some amazing illustrations from the group. La Madriguera is also an interesting and safe space for women to discuss art and gender. There were many activist posters around regarding abortion rights and the space had to be initially a secret location because one particular man had consistently harassed the founder Paula. La Madriguera is now open to the public since the case went to a jury and the perpetrator got a jail sentence. After this workshop I was inspired to keep exploring illustration as a means to reflect on gender equality. Intervention 3 - Midjourney and gender bias \u00b6 This week during the Extended Intelligences course they taught us about synthetic realities. One program that caught my attention was Midjourney and since it is a relatively new tool I wanted to test out if gender bias could be found embedded in the algorithm. To do so, I inputted different sentences to see if any emerging stereotypes showed up on the AI-generated images. - \u201ca group of venture capitalists in an office\u201d - \u201centrepreneurs in a brainstorming session\u201d - \u201cuniversity graduate at a house party\u201d - \u201cuniversity graduate holding diploma\u201d - \u201ctaking care of household chores\u201d - \u201cintimate partner violence\u201d Analysis: - Women and men show equally in \u201cparty\u201d settings - Women tend to show up more than men in student / education settings. - However, men tend to appear more in office-related settings - In household chores and IPV women are more protagonists.

I feel technology can be a powerful tool and ally in helping disrupt gender roles and achieving equality if used correctly. I would love to use MDEF as a means to further explore how emergent technologies can be used to serve this purpose. My previous background experience merges human-centered design and agile methodologies to create digital products at the service of creating new ventures (ie. Colectivo23) and new social programs to combat Intimate Partner Violence (ie. Hablemos Entre Patas). I am interested in merging human-centered methodologies and using evidence-based approaches to achieving change at scale. In Peru and Latin America violence against women is increasingly normalized. On the other hand, investment in technology looks at digitally transforming massive corporations that lean towards monopolies whilst social and urgent problems go unnoticed and underfunded. My passion is to merge the learnings of user-centricity, agility and technology at the service of creating a more gender equal world. At the present moment innovation needs to also tackle societal problems so ingrained and normalized in our social fabric as is violence against women in its multiple forms. I am curious to explore how experiments and prototypes can be conducted in prevention programs and also in other manifestations of gender violence that sit at the lowest part of the iceberg of violence that sometimes go unnoticed, such as stereotypes and sexist humor. Looking at the iceberg can interestingly ignite different areas of opportunity when thinking about emergent futures. For instance, how might we design a fully preventive program that targets male adolescents and children? How can AI provide a different set of tools to manage conversations around gender stereotypes? Can gamification be a useful path in prevention programs since emergency protocols are not as required and especially when designing for younger populations? Can we design a \u201ccoupled\u201d experience for heterosexual couples to mitigate violence? What would the women\u2019s experience vs. male experience look like? What shapes does violence take in a gender fluid future? Who would be the most common perpetrators in said future scenarios? Is violence also directly related to toxic masculinities in the future? What do positive masculinities look like today? What are other factors contributing to gender inequality and what forms do they take in the future? How can we prioritize the causes of IPV and design technology at the service of tackling each of them? Another interesting provocation relates more to designing outside my comfort zone and ideating physical products that may complement the digital experience.

This was eye opening for me since my previous definition of prototyping used to be more linked to experimentation at the service of improving goods and services. Now I realize the power a more exploratory and open-ended approach to prototyping can have in the design process and the richness that can emerge out of this mindset. This is some of my previous experience prototyping: The prototype as an experimental concept. \u00b6 Previously, I have done this type of prototyping by executing A/B tests to determine the best variables for the value proposition of a new service that offered couples counseling for men to reduce conflict. We wanted to learn which type of copy in a Facebook ad generated the highest conversion. We quickly learned that men joining the program were motivated to do so to reduce the number of fights and have happier relationships as opposed to directions that were more vague, offering a new journey or a new challenge. It was important to hit the right tone of voice and communicate the most appealing value proposition since we only had two months to recruit 1,500 men for our pilot service of the program. Without quick prototyping it would\u2019ve been impossible to achieve this ambitious objective. In 2017 me and my team had to define the value proposition and brand for a new education start-up focused on teaching digital skills to Latin American professionals. We quickly designed 3 different websites with opposing look and feels and showed the prototypes to real users. We gathered their reactions and went with the most liked visual direction that was more modern yet bold. The prototype allowed us to have a stronger point of view as to which was the communication path we had to follow. This was a starting point to creating the brand of Colectivo23 , an edtech startup for Latin American professionals that now has over 5,000 alumni. The prototype as a means of inquiry. \u00b6 In 2015 I worked with a group of space and interaction designers from La Victoria Lab and IDEO. We had to test on a 1:1 scale the service design of a new network of low cost high quality healthcare clinics in Peru. We used foam and cheap materials to simulate the different areas. We tested with real users (pregnant women) and helped them navigate the space while gathering their reactions. This prototype allowed us to test with real dimensions while still being low fidelity, cheap and quick to produce. We allowed users to walk freely around the space, move things around and quickly iterated our setup until we were more confident with our design direction. The prototype as a research archetype. \u00b6 I was involved in the creation of a book designed to celebrate and honor a district in Lima called La Victoria. The concept of the book revolved around the past, present and future of the district and in the \u201cfuture\u201d section we built upon the district\u2019s most pressing problems and imagined hypothetical scenarios where these problems are solved through innovation. We worked with an illustrator to define how these could look like. A medium article we wrote about the creative process behind Some questions we explored: What if Gamarra (the textile hub) provided last-mile delivery through accessible technology and created a textile fab lab to collaborate with manufacturers, innovators and fashion stylists? What if we transformed the very dangerous area around the Matute stadium (football stadium) into an active and family-friendly sports hub ? Some early experiments I can think of are: \u00b6 The prototype as a means of inquiry. I am interested in probing - more exploratory and open ended approach to prototyping and letting who I am testing the prototype with explore rather than follow instructions. In my past experiences I have always used rather rigid question and interview guides with very specific research objectives. It would be curious to learn what happens when you go into a research with less clarity about end results. The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry I would love to integrate first person perspective and journal / document the whole process with a storytelling angle. I also wonder what experiments or prototypes can I try from my home and not from a screen. Some of my open-ended design research questions moving forward are: \u00b6 What hyperlocal communities in Barcelona are \u201cgendered\u201d (i.e. all male, all female, queer/only) and what are their primary unattended needs ? How do caregiving roles relate to Intimate Partner Violence? Building on that - how does caregiving relate to domestic tasks and how can we redefine who is in charge of what in a household of the future ? How is masculinity defined in queer spaces? What aspects are those qualified as \u201ctoxic\u201d and which of those in turn lead to increased or potential IPV ? My design space \u00b6 This is an early draft of what my design spaces looks like in October 2022.","title":"Roles of prototyping"},{"location":"term1/03-Roles%20of%20prototyping/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design studio"},{"location":"term1/03-Roles%20of%20prototyping/#roles-of-protoyping","text":"This week we went in-depth in different ways to prototype.

This is some of my previous experience prototyping:","title":"Roles of protoyping"},{"location":"term1/03-Roles%20of%20prototyping/#the-prototype-as-an-experimental-concept","text":"Previously, I have done this type of prototyping by executing A/B tests to determine the best variables for the value proposition of a new service that offered couples counseling for men to reduce conflict. We wanted to learn which type of copy in a Facebook ad generated the highest conversion. We quickly learned that men joining the program were motivated to do so to reduce the number of fights and have happier relationships as opposed to directions that were more vague, offering a new journey or a new challenge. It was important to hit the right tone of voice and communicate the most appealing value proposition since we only had two months to recruit 1,500 men for our pilot service of the program. Without quick prototyping it would\u2019ve been impossible to achieve this ambitious objective. In 2017 me and my team had to define the value proposition and brand for a new education start-up focused on teaching digital skills to Latin American professionals. We quickly designed 3 different websites with opposing look and feels and showed the prototypes to real users. We gathered their reactions and went with the most liked visual direction that was more modern yet bold. The prototype allowed us to have a stronger point of view as to which was the communication path we had to follow. This was a starting point to creating the brand of Colectivo23 , an edtech startup for Latin American professionals that now has over 5,000 alumni.","title":"The prototype as an experimental concept."},{"location":"term1/03-Roles%20of%20prototyping/#the-prototype-as-a-means-of-inquiry","text":"In 2015 I worked with a group of space and interaction designers from La Victoria Lab and IDEO.

We tested with real users (pregnant women) and helped them navigate the space while gathering their reactions. This prototype allowed us to test with real dimensions while still being low fidelity, cheap and quick to produce. We allowed users to walk freely around the space, move things around and quickly iterated our setup until we were more confident with our design direction.","title":"The prototype as a means of inquiry."},{"location":"term1/03-Roles%20of%20prototyping/#the-prototype-as-a-research-archetype","text":"I was involved in the creation of a book designed to celebrate and honor a district in Lima called La Victoria.

I think the fact that the totem is big in size and not as portable is a good example of this reflection. Another reflection I had while building the totem is that adding eyes or an outfit to it allowed me to create a stronger emotional connection with it. If I focused on perceiving it as \u201ccute\u201d, it helped bring me joy and turn a negative emotion into something more positive or at least nostalgic in a constructive manner. Evaluation After spending a whole day with the family totem, I realized due to its size that it is very difficult to carry. It almost feels like a \u201cweight\u201d one needs to let go of to be able to handle daily tasks. This made me reflect how nostalgia or sadness sometimes needs its own space and time to not interrupt with daily life. It is also highly noticeable for others and seems more like something I would want to keep in a private and intimate space. For the second half of the day, I dedicated a special space for the Totem in my living room. This seemed more suitable as I could devote dedicated minutes to staring at it and forcefully thinking of my family back in Peru. One quick reflection I had was related to private / public spaces and where the companion seems to accomplish its objective more meaningfully. Thinking about materiality, if I were to rebuild or iterate this prototype I would use something more durable and polished.

I wanted to explore gender roles, considering that an unequal division of household chores between men and women usually contributes to gender inequality. I was inspired by the 1920s boom in technology when vacuum cleaners and other time-saving electronic devices were invented as a means of empowering women and allowing them to enter the workforce. However, 100 years later women typically spend disproportionately more time on unpaid care work than men even though technology in the cleaning space is still going in the direction of time-saving and automation (such as Roombas). The trend of \u201cCleantoks\u201d on TikTok is making visible the craft of cleaning while mostly women are sharing tips, tricks and hacks to make their homes as clean as possible.

Our team \u201cEagle eyes\u201d had to disassemble a video conference camera that tracks voice to follow participants in a physical space connected to a Zoom call. The device in itself is considerably a few years old. We forgot to test if the device itself worked because of the excitement of beginning to unscrew its components and seeing what was inside this specific \u201cBlack box\u201d. We were very tempted to use a hammer and start breaking things apart but enjoyed the challenge of only using screwdrivers and disassembling it with patience and respecting the final form of each of its parts. One of the highlights of the first week was learning that the individual components sold separately were much more expensive than buying the old video camera on eBay today. The camera had devalued itself considerably in only 5 years because of the low quality of the video camera. However it could be fixed to work perfectly and many of its parts were designed to be thrown out even if it could be designed as a device where the camera is replaced every couple of years to avoid waste creation and having to buy a completely new product. Another observation that stood out for me was that there were red Sharpie marks for labeling individual components inside the device. This gave us a clue that some part of the building of the device was fully manual and relied on man-made effort. The marks seemed to be hastily written down and I was surprised to learn that some part of its industrial assembly line involved humans having to manually label internal components inside the machine. Link to original forensic report https://hackmd.io/FGIM55OESi-aVK3K8WSJNw?view Week 2 \u00b6 During the second week we had to begin by tinkering with the components found inside the Eagle eyes. Our group had fun proposing ideas and letting our judgment go during this stage of the creative process. We brainstormed and ideated ideas as wild as a robotic frog, a cyclops and a zombie. One of the team\u2019s successes was in quickly aligning on a concept and building on top of it during the week. We had to let go of the urge to design in a linear way and try to think of ways to make the product useful. Instead, we had playful fun while making our robot look as aesthetic as possible and making our pendulum swing in a way that would make the movement more exaggerated to simulate a \u201creal hypnosis session.\u201d blockquote Our team was lucky in that it had 3 team members that had previous experience coding, using Arduino and setting up electronics. This meant that we could specialize in specific tasks to manage and distribute the use of time. While this also meant that there was little time for failure in the setting up of the electronics, I learned by observing attentively how my teammates used Arduino and played with the code to ensure the speed, pauses and movement were the correct ones for each of the artifacts we wanted to implement. One of the greatest challenges was in setting up the dependencies within our system. We wanted the pendulum and the robot to start moving at the same time as sound was detected in our sensing boards and this proved to be a challenge in the coding part. Finally, I had a lot of fun stepping out of my comfort zone by tinkering with electronic materials, looking at which motors and sensors could be reused for other purposes and contributing by actively documenting the final presentation and leading the video creation with the help of my team\u2019s creativity in script writing and voice over recording. Overall, I have learned to take ownership of technology I would usually consider \u201cuseless\u201d if not working properly for its original purpose. Hacking technology and tinkering with elements is an interesting way to play with the design process and be swept by what is right in front of you. I will try to apply tinkering to my designer toolkit. Another reflection I will carry with me after these two weeks is to ask more questions regarding hardware and technology, looking at the incentives behind design decisions related to fabrication, use of materials, longevity of the device itself. Some questions that emerged from disassembling the Eagle Eyes and transforming it into a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d: Why are we rewarded for purchasing a completely new product?

Our team \u201cEagle eyes\u201d had to disassemble a video conference camera that tracks voice to follow participants in a physical space connected to a Zoom call. The device in itself is considerably a few years old. We forgot to test if the device itself worked because of the excitement of beginning to unscrew its components and seeing what was inside this specific \u201cBlack box\u201d. We were very tempted to use a hammer and start breaking things apart but enjoyed the challenge of only using screwdrivers and disassembling it with patience and respecting the final form of each of its parts. One of the highlights of the first week was learning that the individual components sold separately were much more expensive than buying the old video camera on eBay today. The camera had devalued itself considerably in only 5 years because of the low quality of the video camera. However it could be fixed to work perfectly and many of its parts were designed to be thrown out even if it could be designed as a device where the camera is replaced every couple of years to avoid waste creation and having to buy a completely new product. Another observation that stood out for me was that there were red Sharpie marks for labeling individual components inside the device. This gave us a clue that some part of the building of the device was fully manual and relied on man-made effort. The marks seemed to be hastily written down and I was surprised to learn that some part of its industrial assembly line involved humans having to manually label internal components inside the machine.

Our group had fun proposing ideas and letting our judgment go during this stage of the creative process. We brainstormed and ideated ideas as wild as a robotic frog, a cyclops and a zombie. One of the team\u2019s successes was in quickly aligning on a concept and building on top of it during the week. We had to let go of the urge to design in a linear way and try to think of ways to make the product useful. Instead, we had playful fun while making our robot look as aesthetic as possible and making our pendulum swing in a way that would make the movement more exaggerated to simulate a \u201creal hypnosis session.\u201d blockquote Our team was lucky in that it had 3 team members that had previous experience coding, using Arduino and setting up electronics. This meant that we could specialize in specific tasks to manage and distribute the use of time. While this also meant that there was little time for failure in the setting up of the electronics, I learned by observing attentively how my teammates used Arduino and played with the code to ensure the speed, pauses and movement were the correct ones for each of the artifacts we wanted to implement. One of the greatest challenges was in setting up the dependencies within our system. We wanted the pendulum and the robot to start moving at the same time as sound was detected in our sensing boards and this proved to be a challenge in the coding part. Finally, I had a lot of fun stepping out of my comfort zone by tinkering with electronic materials, looking at which motors and sensors could be reused for other purposes and contributing by actively documenting the final presentation and leading the video creation with the help of my team\u2019s creativity in script writing and voice over recording. Overall, I have learned to take ownership of technology I would usually consider \u201cuseless\u201d if not working properly for its original purpose. Hacking technology and tinkering with elements is an interesting way to play with the design process and be swept by what is right in front of you. I will try to apply tinkering to my designer toolkit. Another reflection I will carry with me after these two weeks is to ask more questions regarding hardware and technology, looking at the incentives behind design decisions related to fabrication, use of materials, longevity of the device itself. Some questions that emerged from disassembling the Eagle Eyes and transforming it into a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d: Why are we rewarded for purchasing a completely new product? Why is it cheaper to buy a new product if there is more material waste involved? How can we repurpose old technology and use its internal components for new purposes? What are interesting sensors found in everyday devices I already use? What are the political decisions found embedded in the devices I take for granted (i.e. my iPhone, my laptop, my blender)?

One of the highlights for me was getting to know the work of Donella H. Meadows and becoming familiar with visual ways to map systems, including the actors involved but also the root causes and other non-human elements that will inevitably shape the way a system functions. We were provided with hands-on tools to set the stage when dealing with different stakeholders in the same room, each with their own hopes, fears and interests in relation to specific topics that are addressed. Another takeaway for me was that system maps do not attempt to be 100% comprehensive but rather a visual way to communicate complexity. This is why it is not necessary for them to be exhaustive. Another highlight for me was the introduction to the \u201cGroup work card decks\u201d. I chose the \u201cSilence\u201d card when instructed to pick one that resonated most with ourselves at the moment. It reminded me of an advice I was once given by a Project Lead when doing design research. She told me that when interviewing users one should not rush to fulfill the interview guide as quickly as possible but to allow for silence since this is usually when users would give the most interesting reflective and even unexpected answers. I now want to feel comfortable with silence as a design tool and will think of ways to incorporate it in my next interventions as an ally. Visually mapping the complexity of my intervention \u00b6 As an exercise for the class we attempted to map out the conflict related to our collective intervention and to our design space. I focused on school children (since this is the community I will first engage with) in relation to gender stereotypes, expectations and the possibility of domestic violence while also including other factors in the mix. The end result is depicted below. This was my first draft. Although it appears very incomplete I felt it was extremely useful in identifying non-human influences that may be found in the ecosystem and also the ways elements interrelate between each other as I plan to initially engage with children but may later reach out to other types of communities. Another experiment I tried out this week was to visually map the Gender ecosystem in Barcelona I was capturing for my personal project. I used Kumu and this is what the end result looked like. I particularly like how Kumu shows the interconnections between actors and how the movement makes it look like a living organism. Deep diving on the collective intervention and how it relates to the tools learned in community engagement with Holon and Milena, I have outlined the following diagram below. I plan on working with Ariel who is interested in climate change perception and we plan on integrating both a gender and a climate change perspective to our project. Double clicking on my intervention and potential nuances \u00b6 Creative community: School children in Poblenou and Badalona. Context: Gender stereotypes and ways to solve conflict are embedded and ingrained starting from childhood in family homes, schools, media and public places. We are planning on engaging with 6-9 year old school children in high complexity and low complexity schools to understand their perceptions in regards to gender roles and climate change. Current situation: Schools are very eager to engage with students and designers that are willing to use new creative methods for class. This is a great opportunity for us to create a close collaboration with them. On the other hand, we are planning on co-creating future visions with the children themselves since they are the ones that will benefit from better and improved futures in regards to gender inclusiveness and gender equality. Engagement and limits: For engaging with children, we plan on working closely with the teachers that already have the parents\u2019 trust. We also plan to follow strict guidelines to protect the identity of the children in the shareback of the project such as blurring their faces and not mentioning their names or last names. We will also be very mindful of our use of cameras and focus on recording the outputs of the workshop rather than the children themselves. Theory of change: Our theory of change is understanding the voice of children and their perceptions as active designers and co-creators. We will channel horizontality with them and give them the creative tools to design their own future visions. We believe that children are the protagonists of any future engagement and their point of view should be considered from the starting point of any intervention we plan on designing in the future. I also believe that addressing emotional regulation with children and demystifying stereotypes can also be a way to challenge perceptions that violence is an acceptable tool for solving conflict. Design challenges: Some challenges that may emerge are linking the interventions with the content they are taught as part of their academic curriculum. If it is too detached from their day-to-day content we may lose engagement or retention since we can only intervene for a limited amount of time. Another challenge that may engage is related to the use of language in particular when talking about gender. It will be interesting to design ways to address these issues without directly talking about gender, i.e. emotional regulation, inclusion. It will be a challenge to also work with children in different age ranges and socioeconomic status because of varying levels of comprehension and literacy. Design opportunities: There is a great opportunity in visualizing the results of the creative intervention with children and using a maker or creative centered approach. It will be also super rich to learn from the narratives and stories the children themselves propose. There is also an opportunity in designing for the teacher and having the teacher be a facilitator of the activity rather than a passive actor. Because of the creative nature of the intervention, there is an opportunity area to make a fanzine or a creative publication gathering the results of all of the children and seeing what comes out of this collective venture.","title":"Community engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20engagement/#community-engagement","text":"","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20engagement/#mapping-complex-systems","text":"This week we focused on understanding and mapping all the agents involved in complex systems to then ideate ways to intervene at a community level and co-design with all voices in one room.

We began by deep diving on the subject of what is intelligence, looking at definitions as old as Ancient Greece and then linking those concepts back to the latest advancements in these types of technologies. Since AI is built by man-made inputs such as datasets and humans making key decisions behind what is prioritized on those datasets and cleaning the data themselves, it is thus an imperfect product and we should not expect a \u201crobotic\u201d perfection from it. We should actually look for ways to help the AI achieve its end goal looking at mitigating risks for both humans and the environment. The myth that AI is a rational agent is founded upon the myth that robots and humans are at opposing ends of a spectrum. We don\u2019t talk about humans as rational agents as thus we should not expect the same from our man-made technology. Adding to this, AI is also built with intrinsic human biases that we should be on the active lookout for. We were recommended the book \u201cData feminism\u201d (i) to reflect more on how biases can be found in both the datasets and inputs as well as the final AI solutions. Something I found interesting that already existed were datasets that included hate speech or microsexist aggressions in the workplace as a means to actively combat biases. (ii) Group Project - The Active Listener \u00b6 One of the highlights for me was working as a group on designing an AI starting from the concept all the way to the inputs and datasets needed for its creation. Conceptually, it was interesting the questions the exercise itself raised. I particularly remember the example of a team tasked with designing a \u201cpet companion\u201d and questions that this would raise particularly cloud be: How do you design the personality for a dog? What is the personality of a dog? What are the visual signs of a dog\u2019s personality? The categories of types of AI also helped organize my thoughts around it such as planners, recommenders or personal assistants such as Alexa. My team worked on an Active Listener, an AI solution that allowed humans to feel heard by the device and offered empathy in response. It was interesting to me how it was more important to \u201csimulate care and aid\u201d rather than the machine actually comprehending and empathizing with the user or human using it. We want to feel heard just as much as we want to be heard. Another interesting takeaway was the use of the text processor GPT3 that is built on neural networks. Me and Wen were interested in exploring uses of GPT3 as a means for healing in terms of mental health and also violent relationships, and this coincided with the construction of the Active Listener. Running fast experiments on Open AI\u2019s playground, we learned that the tool is surprisingly good at emulating healthy communication barriers, acting empathetic and also being in tune with the user\u2019s emotions. It was fun and also enlightening to play with the technology and datasets while outlining our plan for the Active Listener. The use of Google Colaboratory, shown to us by Taller Estampa, was also a surprising find for me. The logic of working in cells and running the code on an online server showed me how powerful and also increasingly accessible AI is becoming. Finally, I believe this week has been very enlightening for me. Me and Wen will run tests with real users to test our AI version of a bot that can connect people with their younger selves and people they no longer have access to. Personally, I also want to deep dive on Caroline Sinders\u2019 work on feminist data sets and see if AI can be actively built to combat sexist biases.
