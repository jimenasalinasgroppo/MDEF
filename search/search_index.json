This week has been an incredible starting point to begin to comprehend the way MDEF works, the collaborative networks that exist between IAAC and Elisava with other organizations in Poblenou and Barcelona and the mindsets required to thrive in the program. Collaboration does not only occur on a surface level or a physical level with buildings situated right next to each other, but also occurs at a team level and at a discipline level. While being exposed to new neighborhoods, colleagues, collaboration models and learning more about Barcelona, we were also tasked with learning how to set up our Github accounts and understand the logic behind git. These parallel streams have coexisted to provide us with an understanding of what is to come and also build excitement for the possibilities of expanding our design craft. Text: I have always been curious of the impact technology can have in people\u2019s lives and how it can be used for positive change. While digital products may have unintended negative consequences and are shifting towards infinite scrolls and reducing our attention spans, I have always believed tech can also be an empowering tool to bringing people closer, transforming different sectors such as education and healthcare and bridging structural gaps. As a woman and a designer in Peru I want to explore the ways present and future technology can change perceptions, modify behavior and transform lives. Having had the chance to previously collaborate in creating innovative programs that have been scientifically proven to prevent violence against women, I have been exposed to the possibilities digital-first programs can offer in improving female sexual agency, increasing trust and improving emotional regulation in men. I am passionate about scalable work that reduces costs and creates real-lasting change. Gender-based initiatives have been my starting point in learning how tech, design and behavioral incentives can align to modify behavior. In the future I would like to explore other social issues and see how other communities can benefit from digital products and programs designed in an iterative and tested manner. I would love to work across NGOs, governments and corporations in issues with a women-centric lens and above-all a human-centered perspective.","title":"studio"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/#bootcamp","text":"What is my fight?

I feel technology can be a powerful tool and ally in helping disrupt gender roles and achieving equality if used correctly. I would love to use MDEF as a means to further explore how emergent technologies can be used to serve this purpose. My previous background experience merges human-centered design and agile methodologies to create digital products at the service of creating new ventures (ie. Colectivo23) and new social programs to combat Intimate Partner Violence (ie. Hablemos Entre Patas). I am interested in merging human-centered methodologies and using evidence-based approaches to achieving change at scale. In Peru and Latin America violence against women is increasingly normalized. On the other hand, investment in technology looks at digitally transforming massive corporations that lean towards monopolies whilst social and urgent problems go unnoticed and underfunded. My passion is to merge the learnings of user-centricity, agility and technology at the service of creating a more gender equal world. At the present moment innovation needs to also tackle societal problems so ingrained and normalized in our social fabric as is violence against women in its multiple forms. I am curious to explore how experiments and prototypes can be conducted in prevention programs and also in other manifestations of gender violence that sit at the lowest part of the iceberg of violence that sometimes go unnoticed, such as stereotypes and sexist humor.","title":"AoWS"},{"location":"term1/02-Atlas%20of%20Weak%20Signals/#atlas-of-weak-signals","text":"My main weak signals are Non-heteropatriarchal innovation and Technology for equality.
