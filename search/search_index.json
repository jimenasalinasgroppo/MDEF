Lina is very well-connected with the queer community in Barcelona and helped me sharing names of potential NGOs and organizations I could initially reach out to. While some of them did not reply back, I did some desktop research to understand what these initiatives did, what their approach was, what communities they chose to tackle and what their theory of change was. I was able to have conversations with Petra from Shemakes, Flor from Femi\u00f1etas, Ismael from Sexus and Paco from Loba Project. These conversations were very energizing but also intimidating to find out there is so much already being done in this territory in Barcelona. I also went to a conference organized by Plural, a center for masculinities funded by the Ayuntamiento of Barcelona. This is my attempt to sketch out the ecosystem I have identified. This is not comprehensive but gives you some ideas of what it looks like. Activity 1 - Attending a masculinities workshop for Catalan Youth \u00b6 I also attended a 5 session workshop for Catalan youth that revolved around masculinities. I was the only foreigner in the room but everyone was very welcoming. The group was half men and half women, mostly in their early twenties. Women that were attending were there for research purposes (university projects or because they work in psychology fields) while men had more open agendas just being willing to learn and access free education. Ismael, the workshop lead, was very good at creating an atmosphere of reflection and a safe space for everyone to talk about their prejudices, previous preconceptions and future reflections in this subject matter. It felt a very safe space to talk about subjects such as pornography, sexuality and romantic love. Intervention 2 - Signing up for an all-women pointillism class at La Madriguera in Eixample \u00b6 I am very interested in illustration and pursue illustration as a side project. Part of the reason I chose Barcelona as a destination for my Master\u2019s degree is because of La Madriguera. La Madriguera is Paula Bonet\u2019s project where women meet to explore and play with art, illustration and engraving. A month ago I enrolled in a pointillism class with LaLauri, a Spanish artist I admire very much. My goal was to go back to drawing without an iPad, playing with my hands and understanding the role space and community played in these types of workshops. It was great to find out that many women had traveled from other regions of Spain to join the workshop in Barcelona. The structure of the workshop was highly focused on practical tools and exercises to play around and let go of expectations. The end results were incredible as with simple tips and tricks, Laura managed to get some amazing illustrations from the group. La Madriguera is also an interesting and safe space for women to discuss art and gender. There were many activist posters around regarding abortion rights and the space had to be initially a secret location because one particular man had consistently harassed the founder Paula. La Madriguera is now open to the public since the case went to a jury and the perpetrator got a jail sentence. After this workshop I was inspired to keep exploring illustration as a means to reflect on gender equality. Intervention 3 - Midjourney and gender bias \u00b6 This week during the Extended Intelligences course they taught us about synthetic realities. One program that caught my attention was Midjourney and since it is a relatively new tool I wanted to test out if gender bias could be found embedded in the algorithm. To do so, I inputted different sentences to see if any emerging stereotypes showed up on the AI-generated images. - \u201ca group of venture capitalists in an office\u201d - \u201centrepreneurs in a brainstorming session\u201d - \u201cuniversity graduate at a house party\u201d - \u201cuniversity graduate holding diploma\u201d - \u201ctaking care of household chores\u201d - \u201cintimate partner violence\u201d Analysis: - Women and men show equally in \u201cparty\u201d settings - Women tend to show up more than men in student / education settings. - However, men tend to appear more in office-related settings - In household chores and IPV women are more protagonists. This correlates to real life and statistics, however can this also perpetuate stereotypes? Read the whole story in this Medium article I wrote about the research. Intervention 4 - Crafting stories with children in parks \u00b6 For my first collective intervention I partnered with Ariel who was very interested in learning about youth perception in regards to climate change. We chose school children between 6 and 9 years old using collage as a tool to co-create postcards from the future with them and designed a first draft of the workshop which can be read here Making the PDF was a forcing function for us to outline a first version of what the workshop would look like, define an age to collaborate with and think of the objectives of this intervention. Since the schools were finalizing their terms and could not give us a slot of time until January due to Holidays and end of year, we decided to test the intervention in parks and public spaces of Barcelona. We decided to start in a playground for children in el Raval, walk to La Rambla and then to la Superilla. We were inspired by this framework designed by Unicef for workshops to build dioramas. For this intervention we only wanted to focus on the Introduction and Brainstorm parts because of time and space constraints. Our question was: What does the future look like to children? How can we incorporate certain elements to help them imagine these futures? Wen joined our team and we headed out on a Tuesday in the middle of winter to find children and their parents for them to participate in our intervention. We decided it would be best to adapt the format so instead of having the kids build the dioramas, we constructed our own versions of simplified dioramas picking elements that we thought could be good triggers for storytelling. We designed 4 categories (human, non-human, objects and nature) and cut and pasted different figures around these categories on cardboard. In a three-hour trip we were able to listen to 9 stories from over 15 children aged 3-15. We were able to interview a range of ages that was very wide because of the time of the day (noon) and this allowed us to understand what worked best for each age group. These were the stories we heard regarding the future with our cardboards as prompts: - \u201cA kid and a car\u201d - 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval - \u201cThe grass and the hat, and the sloth will go out of the hat.\u201d 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval - \u201cThe baby brushes her teeth, goes to the car and sleeps\u201d. - 3 years old, female in park near Raval - \u201cA boy and her little sister, he teases her and the bees tease them\u201d - 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval. - \u201cThe worm teases the baby.\u201d - 4 year old italian female in park near Raval - \u201cCars are bad for the future because of the gas, I prefer bikes, walking. The future with gas and cars is bad.\u201d - Group of 7-10 year old girls and boys in a park near Raval. They said the future with pollution looks bad. They seem migrants, and are environmentally conscious. Had no adult supervision. - \u201cIn the future technology and contamination are everywhere.\u201d \u201cBarcelona has no space for animals, animals should be free not in zoos\u201d. \u201cNature should have more space in the city\u201d \u201cBarcelona is not very accessible for handicapped people\u201d. - 13-14 year olds girls and boys outside of school in Sant Antoni. Some high level learnings from this first iteration: Location preference: When engaging children in parks, it is hard to do so when they are currently playing since there are a lot of distractions in place. However, places of transit like streets or bus stops are not good because parents or teachers are more focused on mobility and getting their children safe and on time. Engaging teachers in public spaces is also not ideal since they are busy managing large groups of children and do not have the consent from the school or parents to agree to participate in the intervention. Larger groups in public spaces are also difficult to approach since they are focused on the school activity in hand. Street interventions also have a lot of elements of distraction so keeping activities short is essential. Role of parents: Parents act as both translators and facilitators for the exercise (for kids under 6 years old). In some cases they would translate from Catalan and Italian and help us engage children. When parents are present, it is best to approach them first. Consent forms and confidentiality: They didn\u2019t ask for a consent form (even though we bought ones with us) and were ok with us participating as long as they mediated the exercise. Correct age for intervention: While it was interesting to engage with parents and their young children, children under ages of 6 were too young for the type of reflections we needed. They only interpreted quite literally the images we showed them and had a difficult time building stories.This intervention in particular is most suited for children age 10 and above, they have greater critical thinking skills and can more easily make the connections between elements. We still have doubts regarding the artistic style / aesthetic style of the images and if words might be a better prompt. Role of weather and chosen time/date: When weather is too cold, rainy or gray there are less children outside. This seems obvious but influences also the openness of parents and children to participate and engage. Overall, this intervention made us reflect as a team that it would be best for these types of prompts to engage with teenagers since they can interpret things more abstract and in a less literal manner. Some other opportunity areas we identified are: What happens if we input the childrens\u2019 stories in Midjourney or Dall-E? How can we adapt the dynamic for different age ranges? For schools, we intend on keeping our initial target of 6-9 years old and adapt the dynamic for their age and for the setting. We intend to use the Design Dialogues as a first iteration of our prototype using cut outs from old magazines and making 2 sets of groups for the images: one for climate change and one for gender equality. We feel this activity might be more suitable for teenagers and adults but we are interested to see how people engage with the collages and what types of stories they build out.

Intervention 5 - Using GPT3 to imagine alternative use cases of conversational AI with Wen \u00b6 Me and Wen were both interested in the potential uses of GPT3. Inspired by this twitter thread, we set out to figure out how to configure the chat for these cases and build a quick user flow for a potential product related to this. We partnered up to create a first draft of a user navigation flow, system architecture and user persona setting. This was built over two weeks with the purpose of having a prototype that we could show on the Design Dialogues. This experiment related to my areas of interest as I saw an opportunity in being used for the healing stage in cases where people wanted to seek closure from potentially emotionally abusive or physically violent relationships but actually talking with the other person was not the best path. I input potential scenarios into GPT3 where men had been violent to their ex partners but where it was safer for them not to reach out to them personally in order to not interfere with their healing process. For this purpose I transcribed user interviews from previous projects. I tried to be as specific as possible, writing down phrases I had heard from previous projects and situations and recreated a potential dialogue where the man asks for forgiveness from his ex partner. Some early thoughts: User personas: - Victims of violence - receiving apologies and closure - Perpetrators of violence - apologizing and reaching out to victims Questions emerged: - Ethics - controlling addiction Who should use this tool? Therapists? When? - How can we make this accessible and scalable without going through therapists? - How can we use this as a storytelling tool? Mimic potential realistic dialogue between two characters that share a past story? We published this version on Behance to get reactions from users online and recruited users on our social media. We also created this Figma Landing site with all our initial learnings and this Figma Prototype with the most important screens. Wen during Design Dialogues showcasing a demo of our first prototype. How I would iterate the product moving forward: From: A tool for healing IPV by talking to someone you can\u2019t talk to in real life to: A tool for rehearsing hard conversations and detecting red flags and a tool to have conversations with yourself as a means of healing Specific use cases: - Handling break ups - Guiding new parents - Handling difficult conversations at work - Rehearsing conversations with your partner - Healing and asking for forgiveness to a younger self - Interactive journaling Before Design Dialogues I conducted 5 user tests with friends and family. You can check out the reactions here.","title":"Interventions and activities - First Trimester"},{"location":"project/03-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20First%20Trimester/#interventions-and-activities-first-trimester","text":"","title":"Interventions and activities - First Trimester"},{"location":"project/03-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20First%20Trimester/#intervention-1-mapping-the-ecosystem-in-barcelona-in-regards-to-gender","text":"Activities included: Interviewing key stakeholders (5) - Shemakes (Fab lab project) Femi\u00f1etas Sexus Loba Project (MDEF project) Lina from Fab lab My research started speaking to Lina, an audiovisual specialist at Fab Lab.

We feel this activity might be more suitable for teenagers and adults but we are interested to see how people engage with the collages and what types of stories they build out.

Inspired by this twitter thread, we set out to figure out how to configure the chat for these cases and build a quick user flow for a potential product related to this. We partnered up to create a first draft of a user navigation flow, system architecture and user persona setting. This was built over two weeks with the purpose of having a prototype that we could show on the Design Dialogues. This experiment related to my areas of interest as I saw an opportunity in being used for the healing stage in cases where people wanted to seek closure from potentially emotionally abusive or physically violent relationships but actually talking with the other person was not the best path. I input potential scenarios into GPT3 where men had been violent to their ex partners but where it was safer for them not to reach out to them personally in order to not interfere with their healing process. For this purpose I transcribed user interviews from previous projects. I tried to be as specific as possible, writing down phrases I had heard from previous projects and situations and recreated a potential dialogue where the man asks for forgiveness from his ex partner. Some early thoughts: User personas: - Victims of violence - receiving apologies and closure - Perpetrators of violence - apologizing and reaching out to victims Questions emerged: - Ethics - controlling addiction Who should use this tool? Therapists? When? - How can we make this accessible and scalable without going through therapists? - How can we use this as a storytelling tool? Mimic potential realistic dialogue between two characters that share a past story? We published this version on Behance to get reactions from users online and recruited users on our social media. We also created this Figma Landing site with all our initial learnings and this Figma Prototype with the most important screens. Wen during Design Dialogues showcasing a demo of our first prototype. How I would iterate the product moving forward: From: A tool for healing IPV by talking to someone you can\u2019t talk to in real life to: A tool for rehearsing hard conversations and detecting red flags and a tool to have conversations with yourself as a means of healing Specific use cases: - Handling break ups - Guiding new parents - Handling difficult conversations at work - Rehearsing conversations with your partner - Healing and asking for forgiveness to a younger self - Interactive journaling Before Design Dialogues I conducted 5 user tests with friends and family.

This was eye opening for me since my previous definition of prototyping used to be more linked to experimentation at the service of improving goods and services. Now I realize the power a more exploratory and open-ended approach to prototyping can have in the design process and the richness that can emerge out of this mindset. This is some of my previous experience prototyping: The prototype as an experimental concept. \u00b6 Previously, I have done this type of prototyping by executing A/B tests to determine the best variables for the value proposition of a new service that offered couples counseling for men to reduce conflict. We wanted to learn which type of copy in a Facebook ad generated the highest conversion. We quickly learned that men joining the program were motivated to do so to reduce the number of fights and have happier relationships as opposed to directions that were more vague, offering a new journey or a new challenge. It was important to hit the right tone of voice and communicate the most appealing value proposition since we only had two months to recruit 1,500 men for our pilot service of the program. Without quick prototyping it would\u2019ve been impossible to achieve this ambitious objective. In 2017 me and my team had to define the value proposition and brand for a new education start-up focused on teaching digital skills to Latin American professionals. We quickly designed 3 different websites with opposing look and feels and showed the prototypes to real users. We gathered their reactions and went with the most liked visual direction that was more modern yet bold. The prototype allowed us to have a stronger point of view as to which was the communication path we had to follow.

We tested with real users (pregnant women) and helped them navigate the space while gathering their reactions. This prototype allowed us to test with real dimensions while still being low fidelity, cheap and quick to produce. We allowed users to walk freely around the space, move things around and quickly iterated our setup until we were more confident with our design direction. The prototype as a research archetype. \u00b6 I was involved in the creation of a book designed to celebrate and honor a district in Lima called La Victoria.

We worked with an illustrator to define how these could look like. A medium article we wrote about the creative process behind Some questions we explored: What if Gamarra (the textile hub) provided last-mile delivery through accessible technology and created a textile fab lab to collaborate with manufacturers, innovators and fashion stylists?

With a personal background in social sciences and communications, I had never made my own bioplastics before and while doing the experiment with my group it was very humbling to initially get the measurements wrong but then fix the situation collectively. We were awed by what you can make in your own kitchen and how you can start experimenting with new bioplastics at home with materials you can purchase locally and hassle-free.

One takeaway I get is learning to journal and write everything down with as much precision and rigurosity as possible. This is especially useful when analyzing results and coming up with conclusions.

Analyzing a news article and contrasting with the original cited scientific paper \u00b6 Scientific papers and journals are a great source to get closer to scientific evidence, this interests me especially since lately I had previously been working with evidence-based means of generating impact in social science. I was curious to learn more about how scientific papers in the field of biology can be used for this purpose as well. The article I have chosen is from the science section of The Guardian, titled \u201cCommuni-cat-ive: cats attentive to owner\u2019s voice, research finds\u201d. I chose the subject matter because I was curious how this new piece of information could impact and inform the future of human-animal interactions. It argues that cats are able to tune into their human owner\u2019s tone of voice to determine when they are being spoken to. The article does a good job in referring directly to the original research paper, a study done by university students at Paris Nanterre University. The research published in Animal Cognition adds to mounting evidence that one-to-one relationships are important for cats and humans to form strong bonds. Previous research in the field specifically analyzes dogs (linked below) and this is one of the first research focused entirely on cats. This conclusion is interesting since bonds between humans and animals can be found regardless of species. An important following question could be: Are domestic animals more prone to human-animal bonds because of the way they have been conditioned to evolve? The scientific paper was tested with a small cohort of 16 domestic cats and explores human-animal relationship in comparison and contrast to baby-adult relationships. According to the news article, \u201cthey found that the cats were largely unresponsive to hearing a stranger\u2019s voice calling their name, but when their owner did it, 10 of the 16 cats displayed a constellation of behaviours suggesting increased attentiveness.\u201d Because of the framing, rather than a scientific truth the article seems to refer to a rather preliminary and exploratory research that provokes interesting questions. Regarding the original scientific paper, I found that the conclusions established on the news article are similar. However, some observations I could make is that I think the sample the university students worked with is very small. They only studied 16 cats and the news article refers to the results as if they were long-established scientific truths. I would be curious to learn the results of this same research taken one step further, maybe outside academia or at a level beyond university research. A good practice the journalist has done is link to the original scientific paper within the news article. I had no trouble reading the entire scientific paper, including their methodology, observations and conclusions. The exercise has allowed me to understand the importance of going back to the original source and trusting the scientific paper as opposed to the news article\u2019s bold statements. Content-wise, the article poses interesting design questions and implications between human-animal bonds. Bibliography \u00b6 News article: Geddes, L. (2022, October 25).

They only studied 16 cats and the news article refers to the results as if they were long-established scientific truths. I would be curious to learn the results of this same research taken one step further, maybe outside academia or at a level beyond university research. A good practice the journalist has done is link to the original scientific paper within the news article. I had no trouble reading the entire scientific paper, including their methodology, observations and conclusions. The exercise has allowed me to understand the importance of going back to the original source and trusting the scientific paper as opposed to the news article\u2019s bold statements. Content-wise, the article poses interesting design questions and implications between human-animal bonds.","title":"Analyzing a news article and contrasting with the original cited scientific paper"},{"location":"term1/04-Bio%20and%20agri%20zero/#bibliography","text":"News article: Geddes, L.

Whenever I leave my house, I will take it with me inside my purse but allowing for its eyes (2 bottle caps) to look into the outside world. what does it notice? The family totem notices my emotions whenever I miss my family in Peru and can tune into them and distract me by asking me to \u201cfeed it\u201d, \u201cdecorate it\u201d or just stare at it while thinking of my loved ones. what were you thinking? While building it I was thinking of a way to reconnect with my family. Initially I was planning on creating some sort of viewfinder that could allow me to browse through pictures of them, then it evolved into some sort of \u201cdoll\u201d I could care for as a replacement. I now believe its more of a symbolic totem that I should place in a special place to honor their place in my life. why does it matter? The family totem matters because it helped me reflect that rather than \u201creplacing\u201d who you miss it is best to honor the space they occupy while acknowledging the distance. I think the fact that the totem is big in size and not as portable is a good example of this reflection. Another reflection I had while building the totem is that adding eyes or an outfit to it allowed me to create a stronger emotional connection with it. If I focused on perceiving it as \u201ccute\u201d, it helped bring me joy and turn a negative emotion into something more positive or at least nostalgic in a constructive manner. Evaluation After spending a whole day with the family totem, I realized due to its size that it is very difficult to carry. It almost feels like a \u201cweight\u201d one needs to let go of to be able to handle daily tasks. This made me reflect how nostalgia or sadness sometimes needs its own space and time to not interrupt with daily life. It is also highly noticeable for others and seems more like something I would want to keep in a private and intimate space. For the second half of the day, I dedicated a special space for the Totem in my living room. This seemed more suitable as I could devote dedicated minutes to staring at it and forcefully thinking of my family back in Peru. One quick reflection I had was related to private / public spaces and where the companion seems to accomplish its objective more meaningfully. Thinking about materiality, if I were to rebuild or iterate this prototype I would use something more durable and polished. Something I like about the Totem is that it allows you to reminisce in a more free and abstract manner without literally looking at a photograph, which at times can take you to a very specific time and place. First person perspective: Quantifying household chores \u00b6 I wanted to explore a way to quantify household chores using time as a unit of measure while recording myself cleaning my apartment using the slowest mechanism possible (i.e. using a broom as opposed to a vacuum cleaner, hand washing dishes as opposed to using a dishwasher and hand washing my clothes as opposed to using a washing machine). I wanted to explore gender roles, considering that an unequal division of household chores between men and women usually contributes to gender inequality. I was inspired by the 1920s boom in technology when vacuum cleaners and other time-saving electronic devices were invented as a means of empowering women and allowing them to enter the workforce. However, 100 years later women typically spend disproportionately more time on unpaid care work than men even though technology in the cleaning space is still going in the direction of time-saving and automation (such as Roombas). The trend of \u201cCleantoks\u201d on TikTok is making visible the craft of cleaning while mostly women are sharing tips, tricks and hacks to make their homes as clean as possible. I had doubts as to what I could learn from this experiment since these are tasks I mostly do spread out during an entire week and are not completely new to me. I think the process made me reflect on my cleaning process and how caring for your house can also be a political act. There is also value in quantifying the time and effort it requires to perform a task when looking at the potential of dividing chores equally among couples, roommates or families. Additionally, the act of recording yourself doing this task also makes it considerably more visible. Some questions that emerged from this experiment: What does it mean to clean without technology today? How can cleaning without technology evidence the value and time involved in this type of unpaid labor? How can quantifying the time invested in cleaning help with distribution of household chores? How can we reinforce the value in cleaning and re define this \u201cunpaid work\u201d? How can we design public policies around unpaid labor if it isn\u2019t visible?","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"","title":"Living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/05-Living%20with%20your%20own%20ideas/#my-non-living-companion","text":"Family totem The \u201cfamily totem\u201d is my response to finding myself physically distanced from my family. how will you live together?

Our team \u201cEagle eyes\u201d had to disassemble a video conference camera that tracks voice to follow participants in a physical space connected to a Zoom call. The device in itself is considerably a few years old. We forgot to test if the device itself worked because of the excitement of beginning to unscrew its components and seeing what was inside this specific \u201cBlack box\u201d. We were very tempted to use a hammer and start breaking things apart but enjoyed the challenge of only using screwdrivers and disassembling it with patience and respecting the final form of each of its parts. One of the highlights of the first week was learning that the individual components sold separately were much more expensive than buying the old video camera on eBay today. The camera had devalued itself considerably in only 5 years because of the low quality of the video camera. However it could be fixed to work perfectly and many of its parts were designed to be thrown out even if it could be designed as a device where the camera is replaced every couple of years to avoid waste creation and having to buy a completely new product. Another observation that stood out for me was that there were red Sharpie marks for labeling individual components inside the device. This gave us a clue that some part of the building of the device was fully manual and relied on man-made effort. The marks seemed to be hastily written down and I was surprised to learn that some part of its industrial assembly line involved humans having to manually label internal components inside the machine. Link to original forensic report https://hackmd.io/FGIM55OESi-aVK3K8WSJNw?view Week 2 \u00b6 During the second week we had to begin by tinkering with the components found inside the Eagle eyes. Our group had fun proposing ideas and letting our judgment go during this stage of the creative process. We brainstormed and ideated ideas as wild as a robotic frog, a cyclops and a zombie. One of the team\u2019s successes was in quickly aligning on a concept and building on top of it during the week. We had to let go of the urge to design in a linear way and try to think of ways to make the product useful. Instead, we had playful fun while making our robot look as aesthetic as possible and making our pendulum swing in a way that would make the movement more exaggerated to simulate a \u201creal hypnosis session.\u201d blockquote Our team was lucky in that it had 3 team members that had previous experience coding, using Arduino and setting up electronics. This meant that we could specialize in specific tasks to manage and distribute the use of time. While this also meant that there was little time for failure in the setting up of the electronics, I learned by observing attentively how my teammates used Arduino and played with the code to ensure the speed, pauses and movement were the correct ones for each of the artifacts we wanted to implement. One of the greatest challenges was in setting up the dependencies within our system. We wanted the pendulum and the robot to start moving at the same time as sound was detected in our sensing boards and this proved to be a challenge in the coding part. Finally, I had a lot of fun stepping out of my comfort zone by tinkering with electronic materials, looking at which motors and sensors could be reused for other purposes and contributing by actively documenting the final presentation and leading the video creation with the help of my team\u2019s creativity in script writing and voice over recording. Overall, I have learned to take ownership of technology I would usually consider \u201cuseless\u201d if not working properly for its original purpose. Hacking technology and tinkering with elements is an interesting way to play with the design process and be swept by what is right in front of you. I will try to apply tinkering to my designer toolkit. Another reflection I will carry with me after these two weeks is to ask more questions regarding hardware and technology, looking at the incentives behind design decisions related to fabrication, use of materials, longevity of the device itself. Some questions that emerged from disassembling the Eagle Eyes and transforming it into a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d: Why are we rewarded for purchasing a completely new product?

One of the highlights for me was getting to know the work of Donella H. Meadows and becoming familiar with visual ways to map systems, including the actors involved but also the root causes and other non-human elements that will inevitably shape the way a system functions. We were provided with hands-on tools to set the stage when dealing with different stakeholders in the same room, each with their own hopes, fears and interests in relation to specific topics that are addressed. Another takeaway for me was that system maps do not attempt to be 100% comprehensive but rather a visual way to communicate complexity. This is why it is not necessary for them to be exhaustive. Another highlight for me was the introduction to the \u201cGroup work card decks\u201d. I chose the \u201cSilence\u201d card when instructed to pick one that resonated most with ourselves at the moment. It reminded me of an advice I was once given by a Project Lead when doing design research. She told me that when interviewing users one should not rush to fulfill the interview guide as quickly as possible but to allow for silence since this is usually when users would give the most interesting reflective and even unexpected answers. I now want to feel comfortable with silence as a design tool and will think of ways to incorporate it in my next interventions as an ally. Visually mapping the complexity of my intervention \u00b6 As an exercise for the class we attempted to map out the conflict related to our collective intervention and to our design space. I focused on school children (since this is the community I will first engage with) in relation to gender stereotypes, expectations and the possibility of domestic violence while also including other factors in the mix. The end result is depicted below. This was my first draft. Although it appears very incomplete I felt it was extremely useful in identifying non-human influences that may be found in the ecosystem and also the ways elements interrelate between each other as I plan to initially engage with children but may later reach out to other types of communities. Another experiment I tried out this week was to visually map the Gender ecosystem in Barcelona I was capturing for my personal project. I used Kumu and this is what the end result looked like. I particularly like how Kumu shows the interconnections between actors and how the movement makes it look like a living organism.** Double clicking on my intervention and potential nuances \u00b6 Deep diving on the collective intervention and how it relates to the tools learned in community engagement with Holon and Milena, I have outlined the following diagram below. I plan on working with Ariel who is interested in climate change perception and we plan on integrating both a gender and a climate change perspective to our project. Creative community: School children in Poblenou and Badalona. Context: Gender stereotypes and ways to solve conflict are embedded and ingrained starting from childhood in family homes, schools, media and public places. We are planning on engaging with 6-9 year old school children in high complexity and low complexity schools to understand their perceptions in regards to gender roles and climate change. Current situation: Schools are very eager to engage with students and designers that are willing to use new creative methods for class. This is a great opportunity for us to create a close collaboration with them. On the other hand, we are planning on co-creating future visions with the children themselves since they are the ones that will benefit from better and improved futures in regards to gender inclusiveness and gender equality. Engagement and limits: For engaging with children, we plan on working closely with the teachers that already have the parents\u2019 trust. We also plan to follow strict guidelines to protect the identity of the children in the shareback of the project such as blurring their faces and not mentioning their names or last names. We will also be very mindful of our use of cameras and focus on recording the outputs of the workshop rather than the children themselves. Theory of change: Our theory of change is understanding the voice of children and their perceptions as active designers and co-creators. We will channel horizontality with them and give them the creative tools to design their own future visions. We believe that children are the protagonists of any future engagement and their point of view should be considered from the starting point of any intervention we plan on designing in the future. I also believe that addressing emotional regulation with children and demystifying stereotypes can also be a way to challenge perceptions that violence is an acceptable tool for solving conflict. Design challenges: Some challenges that may emerge are linking the interventions with the content they are taught as part of their academic curriculum. If it is too detached from their day-to-day content we may lose engagement or retention since we can only intervene for a limited amount of time. Another challenge that may engage is related to the use of language in particular when talking about gender. It will be interesting to design ways to address these issues without directly talking about gender, i.e. emotional regulation, inclusion. It will be a challenge to also work with children in different age ranges and socioeconomic status because of varying levels of comprehension and literacy. Design opportunities: There is a great opportunity in visualizing the results of the creative intervention with children and using a maker or creative centered approach. It will be also super rich to learn from the narratives and stories the children themselves propose. There is also an opportunity in designing for the teacher and having the teacher be a facilitator of the activity rather than a passive actor. Because of the creative nature of the intervention, there is an opportunity area to make a fanzine or a creative publication gathering the results of all of the children and seeing what comes out of this collective venture.","title":"Community engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20engagement/#community-engagement","text":"","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20engagement/#mapping-complex-systems","text":"This week we focused on understanding and mapping all the agents involved in complex systems to then ideate ways to intervene at a community level and co-design with all voices in one room.

Because of the creative nature of the intervention, there is an opportunity area to make a fanzine or a creative publication gathering the results of all of the children and seeing what comes out of this collective venture.","title":"Double clicking on my intervention and potential nuances"},{"location":"term1/08-Extended%20intelligences/","text":"Extended Intelligences \u00b6 Demystifying Artificial Intelligence \u00b6 The past two weeks we deep dived on the subject of Extended Intelligences and AI in order to demystify it. We began by double clicking on the subject of what is intelligence, looking at definitions as old as Ancient Greece and Plato and then linking those concepts back to the latest advancements in these types of technologies. Since AI is built by man-made inputs such as datasets and the humans behind them are constantly making key decisions on what is prioritized, it is thus an imperfect product and we should not expect a \u201crobotic\u201d perfection from it.

We don\u2019t talk about humans as rational agents and therefore we should not expect the same from our man-made technology. Adding to this, I also learned that AI is built with intrinsic human biases that we should be on the active lookout for. We were recommended the book \u201cData feminism\u201d (i) to reflect more on how biases can be found in both the datasets and inputs as well as the final AI solutions. Something I found interesting that already existed were datasets that included hate speech or microsexist aggressions in the workplace as a means to actively combat biases. (ii) This was of particular interest to me because it showed also how AI can be proactive in identifying hate speech and not just perpetuating it. Group Project - The Active Listener \u00b6 One of the highlights for me was working as a group on designing an AI starting from the concept all the way to the inputs and datasets needed for its creation. Conceptually, it was interesting the questions the exercise itself raised. I particularly remember the example of a team tasked with designing a \u201cpet companion\u201d and the questions that this scenario could raise. For example: How do you design the personality for a dog? What is the personality of a dog and what adjectives should we use? What are the visual signs of a dog\u2019s personality? The categories of types of AI also helped organize my thoughts around my understanding of this type of technology, such as planners, recommenders or personal assistants like Alexa. My team worked on an Active Listener , an AI solution that allowed humans to feel heard by the device and offered empathy in response. It was interesting to me how it was more important to \u201csimulate care and aid\u201d rather than the machine actually comprehending and empathizing with the human using it. We want to feel heard just as much as we want to be heard. Another interesting takeaway was the use of the text processor GPT3 that is built on neural networks. Me and Wen were interested in exploring uses of GPT3 as a means for healing in terms of mental health and also violent relationships, and this coincided with the construction of our Active Listener. Running fast experiments on Open AI\u2019s playground, we learned that the tool is surprisingly good at emulating healthy communication, acting empathetic and also being in tune with the user\u2019s emotions. It was fun and also enlightening to play with the technology and datasets while outlining our plan for the Active Listener. The use of Google Colaboratory, shown to us by Taller Estampa, was also a surprising find for me.

After having an initial prototype, I will seek the aid of a Nonviolent Communication expert and a GBV expert. Intervention 1 Second Trimester- Imagining futures with children \u00b6 Workshop plan \u00b6 We will do a school intervention with 75 9-year old children in Sant Andreu school in Badalona. The activity is divided into 3 classes of approx. 20 children (75 children in total). For us to implement this workshop we had to leverage the trust Xavi and Fab Lab team had already created with schools in Badalona and had to email the Principal and key coordinators for over 2 months. It is hard to schedule activities with children since they need to be integrated into key dates of the academic calendars. Co-creation process \u00b6 For the co-creation process, we first built on the findings from the public parks interventions and design dialogues from Trimester I. Mariana gave us some insights and guidelines to approach the intervention in this second round. We visited the school on Wednesday to co-create with the tutor and ask her relevant content questions, how the exercise fits with the regular curricula and what we can change to create more engagement with the children. We decided to ask children more specific questions - i.e. how do you imagine zoos of the future? or parks of the future? or schools of the future? or sports of the future? as opposed to a general \u201cHow do you imagine the future?\u201d question. This specificity will help them be much more concrete with their answers which is rich input for us as designers. As mentioned above, trust building with schools was done through Xavi\u2019s Fab Lab network and took a couple of months to actually schedule the activity. Since schools have to provide a uniform experience for all children in one grade, we needed to replicate the activity with all 75 students and had to run a pretty big pilot. We decided to start off with only one class and then iterate the activity for the remaining 2 classes. 1 st intervention with 24 children \u00b6 Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 20 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 24 children The workshop lasted 45 minutes. The teachers were very open to what we proposed and actually felt they couldn\u2019t interrupt our session. Children were very happy and motivated by our presence. We documented photos, videos and voice recordings but were careful to take pictures of their individual faces because of child protection laws. One thing we noticed we could improve was help teachers feel more involved with the activity. We felt that teachers felt they could take a break and rest from their busy schedules but were also very interested and curious of the content. Incorporating teachers more actively can be something we can improve later on. In preparation for the activity, we designed a short presentation that would serve as an introduction (who we are, our backgrounds, where we come from and introduction to climate change and gender equality). You can check the attached presentation here with our group findings and you can hear some of their stories from this session here. Mapped improvements for next iterations: \u00b6 Show collage cutouts later since children are easily distracted. Once they saw the collage cut outs they stopped thinking of the futures and focused more on the images themselves. Spend a bit more time on introduction, asking them questions about the topic area and having a horizontal conversation. They are very young so they are more interested in animals than in humans. They do not comprehend very much gender inequality. It is a very complex subject for them so it would be best to talk about inclusion in general. Teachers are willing to do more activities with them and use innovative tools in their classes. This can also be an opportunity to onboard teachers on new tools and exercises. Teachers want to participate too! and design their futures. First teacher imagined a school with modular furniture that quickly transformed into different settings for diverse learning styles. Children are happy to help us imagine futures and enthusiastic about welcoming new people into their classrooms. Childrens\u2019 imagined futures grouped thematically: \u00b6 Parks: New animal species. Animals, fruits and no cars so animals are not scared, vet in parks. Pokemons are part of parks. Schools: Poor children are fed in schools, bread to feed everyone in schools. Zoos: Punishing people that kill animals by making them go to jail, animal protection. No zoos, animals free to roam around. People in charge of animal rescue. Animals are trained to become stronger so we can live with wild animals and feed them, live with them without killing others. Where you can be friends with animals and they are not hunted. Sports: Each person chooses their uniform, their way to express themselves. In one same area all sports can be held in the same area, it can be transformed for different sports. Emerging insights from this first intervention: \u00b6 Better futures for children are more inclusive futures and non-humans are very included. Mindful of eating, nourishment, especially for poor children. Children imagine better futures in regards to inclusion more than inequality, ie. letting all animals be in a zoo, letting everyone participate in sports, no uniforms, letting everyone express themselves freely. Sidenote: Children associate \u201cpoor\u201d people with racial diversity. Children have a hard time also reflecting on their own school experience and prefer to design for children from lower income families. My personal takeaways on how this intervention relates to emerging visions on gender equality: \u00b6 Children have a hard time imagining gender equality since they are unaware of how society impacts human beings differently according to gender. However children can imagine and imagine a world with more inclusion. This looks like olympics and soccer matches for all ages and all genders, where uniform is a personal choice of expression. Some visions children imagined: \u00b6 Household tasks are distributed equally Interspecies schooling Housing for everyone Places of repair and healing in public spaces This allows us to build a future where preservation and care are pillars in equality and inclusion. 2 nd intervention with 50 children \u00b6 Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 27 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 50 children (2 classes) The workshop will be almost identical with the previous one with some changes. The children will imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. For this second iteration of intervention with children, we decided to not show the collage cut outs from the start and to let the children spend more time ideating and focusing on crafting more compelling stories. We allowed them to use color pencils and crayons and not to focus on using cut outs from magazines. This second iteration gave us the following results: \u00b6 After we introduced the collage cut outs, no children used the cut outs anymore. We realized they were more distracting than adding to the experience. What you show at first is crucial for children since it is what they will focus their attention on. Children spent more time collaborating and listening to their peers when they didn\u2019t have distracting elements. The end stories were more reflexive and of higher quality this time around. With the collage in the first iteration, they struggled incorporating all the elements and with no collages being shown, they could focus on their stories and adding details to the stories. Question for future iterations: If we choose not to use collage anymore, what would be the minimum viable prompts we would need to give children for better stories and more engagement? Is the template with the backdrop enough or is there any other element we can incorporate that adds to the experience? Some insights from the second iteration: \u00b6 Content-wise, children are overall optimistic and positive about the future. Some emerging themes from this session: Redistribution of wealth (ie. feeding the poor, free housing for the poor) Inclusion (ie. Sports for all ages and all genders) Freedom (ie. Abolishing zoos) Diversity (ie. New species, interspecies schools) ou can check the attached presentation here with our group findings. We received the feedback from faculty to make the workshop more participatory in the sense that children are given increased agency, new facilitation roles and we let go of control to see where the activity takes us and how this can influence their imagined futures. We will also talk to a school psychologist for a future iteration. Ask ourselves, how can this feel co-created rather than imposed?","title":"Design studio"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#design-studio-second-trimester","text":"Assignment: Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back.

The activity is divided into 3 classes of approx. 20 children (75 children in total). For us to implement this workshop we had to leverage the trust Xavi and Fab Lab team had already created with schools in Badalona and had to email the Principal and key coordinators for over 2 months. It is hard to schedule activities with children since they need to be integrated into key dates of the academic calendars.","title":"Workshop plan"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#co-creation-process","text":"For the co-creation process, we first built on the findings from the public parks interventions and design dialogues from Trimester I. Mariana gave us some insights and guidelines to approach the intervention in this second round. We visited the school on Wednesday to co-create with the tutor and ask her relevant content questions, how the exercise fits with the regular curricula and what we can change to create more engagement with the children. We decided to ask children more specific questions - i.e. how do you imagine zoos of the future? or parks of the future? or schools of the future? or sports of the future? as opposed to a general \u201cHow do you imagine the future?\u201d question. This specificity will help them be much more concrete with their answers which is rich input for us as designers. As mentioned above, trust building with schools was done through Xavi\u2019s Fab Lab network and took a couple of months to actually schedule the activity. Since schools have to provide a uniform experience for all children in one grade, we needed to replicate the activity with all 75 students and had to run a pretty big pilot. We decided to start off with only one class and then iterate the activity for the remaining 2 classes.","title":"Co-creation process"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#1st-intervention-with-24-children","text":"Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 20 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 24 children The workshop lasted 45 minutes. The teachers were very open to what we proposed and actually felt they couldn\u2019t interrupt our session. Children were very happy and motivated by our presence. We documented photos, videos and voice recordings but were careful to take pictures of their individual faces because of child protection laws. One thing we noticed we could improve was help teachers feel more involved with the activity. We felt that teachers felt they could take a break and rest from their busy schedules but were also very interested and curious of the content. Incorporating teachers more actively can be something we can improve later on. In preparation for the activity, we designed a short presentation that would serve as an introduction (who we are, our backgrounds, where we come from and introduction to climate change and gender equality).

Remixing materials is an important part of achieving a more sustainable, circular economy. Remixing materials also allows us to create innovative new materials from existing organic and waste materials.

Experiments with music playing with Arduino Uno. Experiments with music playing with Arduino Uno. Week 1 - Day 2 \u00b6 Today Eduardo taught us more about modelling and 3D models. He started by introducing terminology such as pixels vs vectors and going to basics allowed all of us to start with a clear mind. One of the technical highlights for me was learning the importance of reducing image file sizes when uploading them to a website and being mindful of the ecological impact of not doing this. Micro challenge 2.1 Parametrizing a croissant \u00b6 I asked Chat GPT3 to parametrize a croissant since I have zero experience with modeling and 3D software besides 3Ds max when I was doing an animation class on product advertising. First I used Noun Project to look for 2D croissant vectors. I then looked for open Rhino libraries that would allow me to look for different croissant models. I downloaded one that looked the most simple and opened it up on Rhino. Micro challenge 2.2 Create a 3D design based on algorithmic thinking of any object or concept you like. \u00b6 This was very exciting for me because I have zero experience modelling but the tools are very accesible. I was interested in exploring how to do 3D models of illustrations and logotypes and deep dive on that a bit more. I really like the work of Cabeza Patata, an illustration collective that does 3D renderings of illustrations. The software I chose was Blender, I wanted to get familiar with the tool and saw there was a very big internet community offering free tutorials. I started first watching introductory tutorials that showed me keyboard shortcuts and the logic behind the tool. I wanted to create a 3D version of a logotype I had created for a client last year. I chose that image because the shape is pretty simple and would have a potential use if I sent it back to the client. I made this video outlining the end result and sharing a bit of my process. I learned to use the Boolean tool as a means to cut shapes inside the 3D model. The logic to me was very familiar as this is a technique I used when playing around with 2D vectors and typography. I am really content with the end result even though I know it is quite basic. This made me aware that my interest in 3D modeling is more connected to illustration and branding rather than to engineering or making products. I also tried to input \u201c3D render letter M\u201d on stable diffusion to see how the AI generated models looked like and how much they could serve me for this purpose. Week 2 - Day 1 \u00b6 Today we learned about laser cutting and vinyl cutting. What resonated with me most was the application of these techniques for building installations and communicating ideas in spaces. Using pens with the vinyl cutter was also incredible, a way to mix an analog and traditional technique with the digital. Micro challenge 3 Create a parametric model and print it. \u00b6 To explore laser cutting press-fit for the first time I chose to build out of an existing file of a cat. I then modified the file size a bit to fit the laser cut machine and added my name to personalize the cat. What was hardest of the process was setting up the properties on the laser cut machine to have the correct scale, position the laser in the right corner and understanding the colors for engraving and cutting. I set up the file with Wen and Carolina and we needed to ask Eduardo and Josep for help a couple of times. We used some spare cardboard that had already been used for our initial prototypes before using a fancier cardboard for the end result. While testing out the final materials the press fit was right on point for the cat but not so much for the airplane I also printed out on cardboard. This was because the model was too small and the material was not rigid enough. For the future I would love to explore using laster cutting for exhibit design mixing engraving with cut parts using negative space for typography. Week 2 - Day 2 \u00b6 We learned about inputs and outputs from Victor. It was very inspiring to learn how sensors such as GPS actually work and to see the potential of using sensors in fields such as biology where electronics has not been very funded or investigated much before. I also enjoyed learning about DIY communities in Japan where making your own input and output systems is a great way to also combat private corporations using personal data for their own gain. Some questions asked during class that resonate with me: Why is Alexa so cheap if the investment for its development was so expensive? Answer: potentially they want to aim for the most quantity of Alexa\u2019s per household to gain our data and use that for profit. The list of sensors and potential inputs was also very exhaustive and allwoed us as a group to push our thinking into what we can begin to monitor, especially for groups looking at collaboration with nature and water. Micro challenge 4 Arduino challenge inputs and outputs \u00b6 For this challenge I came to IAAC with Carolina, Wen, Sami and Josephine on Friday. We tried to individually set up our Arduinos to either light up the LED with the switch and to use the sensor correctly on a separate board. We realized this task would take us much more time than we initially thought. I worked with Carolina trying to connect the switch to the LED light and were succesful for a period of time but then the Arduino stopped working. We tried plugging and re plugging everything but it didn\u2019t work again. Finally we got the board to keep working and focused on integrating our output with the sensor Sami and Josephine had been working on. We had fun seeing how far we could go on connecting both systems. This was the code we used to get the output to work correctly (LED light). /* Button Turns on and off a light emitting diode(LED) connected to digital pin 13, when pressing a pushbutton attached to pin 2.

If it is, the buttonState is HIGH: if (buttonState == HIGH) { // turn LED on: digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); Week 3 - First Fab Lab challenge \u00b6 This week I worked with Ariel and Wen to develop a physical product that would allow us to engage with children\u2019s perceptions in relation to 3 different fields: climate change, gender equality and mental health. We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incoporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. My participation in the project was primarily in designing the concept and MVP in digital format, looking at how the user interaction would work inside a classroom and how would the use of the Perception Board work integrating the cards, questions and the x and y axis. I then designed the question cards, iterating the content itself so it would be more understandable by children. My role was also to help set up the laser cutting and help Ariel and Wen finalize Rhino file details and pasting the parts of the final piece together with glue. We will test the product with the school we previously worked but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. What our final board looked like after connecting a circuit and coding Arduino for LED lights to switch on using a button. What our product looked like after a hands-on week of a lot of iterations, learnings and testing out new things. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers.

I was interested in exploring how to do 3D models of illustrations and logotypes and deep dive on that a bit more. I really like the work of Cabeza Patata, an illustration collective that does 3D renderings of illustrations. The software I chose was Blender, I wanted to get familiar with the tool and saw there was a very big internet community offering free tutorials. I started first watching introductory tutorials that showed me keyboard shortcuts and the logic behind the tool. I wanted to create a 3D version of a logotype I had created for a client last year. I chose that image because the shape is pretty simple and would have a potential use if I sent it back to the client. I made this video outlining the end result and sharing a bit of my process. I learned to use the Boolean tool as a means to cut shapes inside the 3D model. The logic to me was very familiar as this is a technique I used when playing around with 2D vectors and typography. I am really content with the end result even though I know it is quite basic. This made me aware that my interest in 3D modeling is more connected to illustration and branding rather than to engineering or making products.

I set up the file with Wen and Carolina and we needed to ask Eduardo and Josep for help a couple of times. We used some spare cardboard that had already been used for our initial prototypes before using a fancier cardboard for the end result. While testing out the final materials the press fit was right on point for the cat but not so much for the airplane I also printed out on cardboard.

We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incoporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. My participation in the project was primarily in designing the concept and MVP in digital format, looking at how the user interaction would work inside a classroom and how would the use of the Perception Board work integrating the cards, questions and the x and y axis. I then designed the question cards, iterating the content itself so it would be more understandable by children. My role was also to help set up the laser cutting and help Ariel and Wen finalize Rhino file details and pasting the parts of the final piece together with glue. We will test the product with the school we previously worked but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. What our final board looked like after connecting a circuit and coding Arduino for LED lights to switch on using a button. What our product looked like after a hands-on week of a lot of iterations, learnings and testing out new things. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers.

Subjectivity always exist so it is best to embrace it rather than hiding it and pretending it doesn\u2019t exist.
