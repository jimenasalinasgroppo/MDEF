My passion is to design solutions that empower and unlock opportunities for underserved demographics. My dream is to devote my professional life to solving inequalities, challenging structural gaps through design and storytelling. I have focused my career on helping new education ventures and cultural transformation projects thrive by leading and participating in cross-disciplinary design projects. But these methodologies have gaps, when a solid research base is not present and when leaders are not committed to questioning the status quo. Seven years into this journey, I have realized the importance of complementing the human-centered design methodology with insights that take into account the complex nuances of structural inequality. The pandemic hit Latin America, widening disparities and reversing progress. My goal is to help overcome these setbacks and secure an even brighter future for the upcoming generations. My bold hypothesis is that ventures need compelling narratives intentionally designed to solve structural inequality. I still have to acquire deeper knowledge in research and prototyping and I want to expand my network to collaborate with like-minded professionals and subject matter experts to solve some of these problems. The illustration above visually represents how I feel right now, between two different states of being. I also like to illustrate in my free time.","title":"About"},{"location":"about/me/#about","text":"Design Lead & Communications strategist with over 7 years of experience in innovation projects, venture building and cultural transformation initiatives.

I feel technology can be a powerful tool and ally in helping disrupt gender roles and achieving equality if used correctly. I would love to use MDEF as a means to further explore how emergent technologies can be used to serve this purpose. My previous background experience merges human-centered design and agile methodologies to create digital products at the service of creating new ventures (ie. Colectivo23) and new social programs to combat Intimate Partner Violence (ie. Hablemos Entre Patas). I am interested in merging human-centered methodologies and using evidence-based approaches to achieving change at scale. In Peru and Latin America violence against women is increasingly normalized. On the other hand, investment in technology looks at digitally transforming massive corporations that lean towards monopolies whilst social and urgent problems go unnoticed and underfunded. My passion is to merge the learnings of user-centricity, agility and technology at the service of creating a more gender equal world. At the present moment innovation needs to also tackle societal problems so ingrained and normalized in our social fabric as is violence against women in its multiple forms. I am curious to explore how experiments and prototypes can be conducted in prevention programs and also in other manifestations of gender violence that sit at the lowest part of the iceberg of violence that sometimes go unnoticed, such as stereotypes and sexist humor. Looking at the iceberg can interestingly ignite different areas of opportunity when thinking about emergent futures. For instance, how might we design a fully preventive program that targets male adolescents and children? How can AI provide a different set of tools to manage conversations around gender stereotypes? Can gamification be a useful path in prevention programs since emergency protocols are not as required and especially when designing for younger populations? Can we design a \u201ccoupled\u201d experience for heterosexual couples to mitigate violence? What would the women\u2019s experience vs. male experience look like? What shapes does violence take in a gender fluid future? Who would be the most common perpetrators in said future scenarios? Is violence also directly related to toxic masculinities in the future? What do positive masculinities look like today? What are other factors contributing to gender inequality and what forms do they take in the future? How can we prioritize the causes of IPV and design technology at the service of tackling each of them? Another interesting provocation relates more to designing outside my comfort zone and ideating physical products that may complement the digital experience. How might we design a physical tool or object that aids in mitigating violence or designing positive masculinities? What are the necessary roles that need to be in place for these types of programs or services?

This was eye opening for me since my previous definition of prototyping used to be more linked to experimentation at the service of improving goods and services. Now I realize the power a more exploratory and open-ended approach to prototyping can have in the design process and the richness that can emerge out of this mindset. This is some of my previous experience prototyping: The prototype as an experimental concept. \u00b6 Previously, I have done this type of prototyping by executing A/B tests to determine the best variables for the value proposition of a new service that offered couples counseling for men to reduce conflict. We wanted to learn which type of copy in a Facebook ad generated the highest conversion. We quickly learned that men joining the program were motivated to do so to reduce the number of fights and have happier relationships as opposed to directions that were more vague, offering a new journey or a new challenge. It was important to hit the right tone of voice and communicate the most appealing value proposition since we only had two months to recruit 1,500 men for our pilot service of the program. Without quick prototyping it would\u2019ve been impossible to achieve this ambitious objective. In 2017 me and my team had to define the value proposition and brand for a new education start-up focused on teaching digital skills to Latin American professionals. We quickly designed 3 different websites with opposing look and feels and showed the prototypes to real users. We gathered their reactions and went with the most liked visual direction that was more modern yet bold. The prototype allowed us to have a stronger point of view as to which was the communication path we had to follow. This was a starting point to creating the brand of Colectivo23 , an edtech startup for Latin American professionals that now has over 5,000 alumni. The prototype as a means of inquiry. \u00b6 In 2015 I worked with a group of space and interaction designers from La Victoria Lan and IDEO. We had to test on a 1:1 scale the service design of a new network of low cost high quality healthcare clinics in Peru. We used foam and cheap materials to simulate the different areas. We tested with real users (pregnant women) and helped them navigate the space while gathering their reactions. This prototype allowed us to test with real dimensions while still being low fidelity, cheap and quick to produce. We allowed users to walk freely around the space, move things around and quickly iterated our setup until we were more confident with our design direction. The prototype as a research archetype. \u00b6 I was involved in the creation of a book designed to celebrate and honor a district in Lima called La Victoria. The concept of the book revolved around the past, present and future of the district and in the \u201cfuture\u201d section we built upon the district\u2019s most pressing problems and imagined hypothetical scenarios where these problems are solved through innovation. We worked with an illustrator to define how these could look like. A medium article we wrote about the creative process behind Some questions we explored: What if Gamarra (the textile hub) provided last-mile delivery through accessible technology and created a textile fab lab to collaborate with manufacturers, innovators and fashion stylists? What if we transformed the very dangerous area around the Matute stadium (football stadium) into an active and family-friendly sports hub ? Some early experiments I can think of are: \u00b6 The prototype as a means of inquiry. I am interested in probing - more exploratory and open ended approach to prototyping and letting who I am testing the prototype with explore rather than follow instructions. In my past experiences I have always used rather rigid question and interview guides with very specific research objectives. It would be curious to learn what happens when you go into a research with less clarity about end results. The process of prototyping as a vehicle for inquiry I would love to integrate first person perspective and journal / document the whole process with a storytelling angle. I also wonder what experiments or prototypes can I try from my home and not from a screen. Some of my open-ended design research questions moving forward are: \u00b6 What hyperlocal communities in Barcelona are \u201cgendered\u201d (i.e. all male, all female, queer/only) and what are their primary unattended needs ? How does caregiving roles relate to Intimate Partner Violence? Building on that - how does caregiving relate to domestic tasks and how can we redefine who is in charge of what in a household of the future ? How is masculinity defined in queer spaces? What aspects are those qualified as \u201ctoxic\u201d and which of those in turn lead to increased or potential IPV ? My design space \u00b6 This is an early draft of what my design spaces looks like in October 2022.","title":"Design studio"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20studio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design studio"},{"location":"term1/03-Design%20studio/#roles-of-protoyping","text":"This week we went in-depth in different ways to prototype.

It was really mind blowing from me to learn about biology intersecting with design and biomaterial creation. Learning about biohackers and its correlation with cyber punk was incredibly inspiring as making biology accessible and DIY is one of the first steps towards empowerment and decentralizing knowledge. With a background in social sciences and communications I had never made my own bio plastics and while doing the experiment with my group it was very humbling to initially get the measurements wrong but then fix the situation collectively. We were awed by what you can make in your own kitchen and how you can start experimenting with new bioplastics at home. After these two weeks I am inspired by the potential of combining the discipline of design with biology, especially as it can correlate with public policy, new material creation and circular economy and more sustainable ways of inhabiting planet Earth. As designers, we learn how to experiment in a maybe less organized and systematic way. One takeaway I get is learning to journal and write everything down with as much precision and rigurosity as possible. This is especially useful when analyzing results and coming up with conclusions. Peer reviews and collaboration in scientific papers also make me wonder how that can be translated to the design space with the same rigurosity and spirit of new knowledge creation. Some of my favorite moments from the past two weeks captured in photographs This experiment was a highlight for me because of the takeaway that using eyesight to determine pH (or any other measurement) will never be as effective as using a tool that provides an accurate numerological value. This experiment was a highlight for me from a visual standpoint and the inspiration you can get just by zooming in. Pictured above a human cell using my iPhone and a portable microscope. The result is very impressive considering the hands-on technology. This final picture is inspiring to me as it showcases how you can create bioplastics using regular kitchen tools. My group decided to add apple peel to the mix just to experiment how texture might change in cotnrast. Analyzing a news article and contrasting with the original cited scientific paper \u00b6 Scientific papers and journals are a great source to get closer to scientific evidence, this interests me especially since lately I had previously been working with evidence-based means of generating impact or change in social science and am curious to learn more about how this can relate to biology as well. The article I have chosen is from The Guardian, titled \u201cCommuni-cat-ive: cats attentive to owner\u2019s voice, research finds\u201d. I chose the subject matter because I was curious how this new piece of information could impact human-animal interactions. It argues that cats are able to tune into their human owner\u2019s tone of voice to determine when they are being spoken to. The article does a good job in referring directly to the original research paper, a study done by university students at Paris Nanterre University. The research, published in Animal Cognition, adds to mounting evidence that one-to-one relationships are important for cats and humans to form strong bonds. Regarding the original scientific paper, I found that the conclusions are similar. However, I think the sample is very small to determine that said results are scientific truths. I would be curious to learn the results of research taken one step further, maybe outside academia or at a level beyond university research. A good practice the journalist has done is link to the original scientific paper within the news article. The scientific paper was tested with a small cohort of 16 domestic cats. Explores human-animal relationship and compares and contrasts to baby-adult relationships. The exercise has allowed me to understand the importance of going back to the original source and trusting the scientific paper as opposed to the news article\u2019s bold statements. Content-wise, the article poses interesting design questions and implications between human-animal bonds. Bibliography \u00b6 News article: Geddes, L. (2022, October 25).
