Lina is very well-connected with the queer community in Barcelona and helped me sharing names of potential NGOs and organizations I could initially reach out to. While some of them did not reply back, I did some desktop research to understand what these initiatives did, what their approach was, what communities they chose to tackle and what their theory of change was. I was able to have conversations with Petra from Shemakes, Flor from Femi\u00f1etas, Ismael from Sexus and Paco from Loba Project. These conversations were very energizing but also intimidating to find out there is so much already being done in this territory in Barcelona. I also went to a conference organized by Plural, a center for masculinities funded by the Ayuntamiento of Barcelona. This is my attempt to sketch out the ecosystem I have identified. This is not comprehensive but gives you some ideas of what it looks like. Activity 1 - Attending a masculinities workshop for Catalan Youth \u00b6 I also attended a 5 session workshop for Catalan youth that revolved around masculinities. I was the only foreigner in the room but everyone was very welcoming. The group was half men and half women, mostly in their early twenties. Women that were attending were there for research purposes (university projects or because they work in psychology fields) while men had more open agendas just being willing to learn and access free education. Ismael, the workshop lead, was very good at creating an atmosphere of reflection and a safe space for everyone to talk about their prejudices, previous preconceptions and future reflections in this subject matter. It felt a very safe space to talk about subjects such as pornography, sexuality and romantic love. Intervention 2 - Signing up for an all-women pointillism class at La Madriguera in Eixample \u00b6 I am very interested in illustration and pursue illustration as a side project. Part of the reason I chose Barcelona as a destination for my Master\u2019s degree is because of La Madriguera. La Madriguera is Paula Bonet\u2019s project where women meet to explore and play with art, illustration and engraving. A month ago I enrolled in a pointillism class with LaLauri, a Spanish artist I admire very much. My goal was to go back to drawing without an iPad, playing with my hands and understanding the role space and community played in these types of workshops. It was great to find out that many women had traveled from other regions of Spain to join the workshop in Barcelona. The structure of the workshop was highly focused on practical tools and exercises to play around and let go of expectations. The end results were incredible as with simple tips and tricks, Laura managed to get some amazing illustrations from the group. La Madriguera is also an interesting and safe space for women to discuss art and gender. There were many activist posters around regarding abortion rights and the space had to be initially a secret location because one particular man had consistently harassed the founder Paula. La Madriguera is now open to the public since the case went to a jury and the perpetrator got a jail sentence. After this workshop I was inspired to keep exploring illustration as a means to reflect on gender equality. Intervention 3 - Midjourney and gender bias \u00b6 This week during the Extended Intelligences course they taught us about synthetic realities. One program that caught my attention was Midjourney and since it is a relatively new tool I wanted to test out if gender bias could be found embedded in the algorithm. To do so, I inputted different sentences to see if any emerging stereotypes showed up on the AI-generated images. - \u201ca group of venture capitalists in an office\u201d - \u201centrepreneurs in a brainstorming session\u201d - \u201cuniversity graduate at a house party\u201d - \u201cuniversity graduate holding diploma\u201d - \u201ctaking care of household chores\u201d - \u201cintimate partner violence\u201d Analysis: - Women and men show equally in \u201cparty\u201d settings - Women tend to show up more than men in student / education settings. - However, men tend to appear more in office-related settings - In household chores and IPV women are more protagonists. This correlates to real life and statistics, however can this also perpetuate stereotypes? Read the whole story in this Medium article I wrote about the research. Intervention 4 - Crafting stories with children in parks \u00b6 For my first collective intervention I partnered with Ariel who was very interested in learning about youth perception in regards to climate change. We chose school children between 6 and 9 years old using collage as a tool to co-create postcards from the future with them and designed a first draft of the workshop which can be read here Making the PDF was a forcing function for us to outline a first version of what the workshop would look like, define an age to collaborate with and think of the objectives of this intervention. Since the schools were finalizing their terms and could not give us a slot of time until January due to Holidays and end of year, we decided to test the intervention in parks and public spaces of Barcelona. We decided to start in a playground for children in el Raval, walk to La Rambla and then to la Superilla. We were inspired by this framework designed by Unicef for workshops to build dioramas. For this intervention we only wanted to focus on the Introduction and Brainstorm parts because of time and space constraints. Our question was: What does the future look like to children? How can we incorporate certain elements to help them imagine these futures? Wen joined our team and we headed out on a Tuesday in the middle of winter to find children and their parents for them to participate in our intervention. We decided it would be best to adapt the format so instead of having the kids build the dioramas, we constructed our own versions of simplified dioramas picking elements that we thought could be good triggers for storytelling. We designed 4 categories (human, non-human, objects and nature) and cut and pasted different figures around these categories on cardboard. In a three-hour trip we were able to listen to 9 stories from over 15 children aged 3-15. We were able to interview a range of ages that was very wide because of the time of the day (noon) and this allowed us to understand what worked best for each age group. These were the stories we heard regarding the future with our cardboards as prompts: - \u201cA kid and a car\u201d - 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval - \u201cThe grass and the hat, and the sloth will go out of the hat.\u201d 5 years old, male catalan in Park near Raval - \u201cThe baby brushes her teeth, goes to the car and sleeps\u201d. - 3 years old, female in park near Raval - \u201cA boy and her little sister, he teases her and the bees tease them\u201d - 4 year old Italian female in a park near Raval. - \u201cThe worm teases the baby.\u201d - 4 year old italian female in park near Raval - \u201cCars are bad for the future because of the gas, I prefer bikes, walking. The future with gas and cars is bad.\u201d - Group of 7-10 year old girls and boys in a park near Raval. They said the future with pollution looks bad. They seem migrants, and are environmentally conscious. Had no adult supervision. - \u201cIn the future technology and contamination are everywhere.\u201d \u201cBarcelona has no space for animals, animals should be free not in zoos\u201d. \u201cNature should have more space in the city\u201d \u201cBarcelona is not very accessible for handicapped people\u201d. - 13-14 year olds girls and boys outside of school in Sant Antoni. Some high level learnings from this first iteration: Location preference: When engaging children in parks, it is hard to do so when they are currently playing since there are a lot of distractions in place. However, places of transit like streets or bus stops are not good because parents or teachers are more focused on mobility and getting their children safe and on time. Engaging teachers in public spaces is also not ideal since they are busy managing large groups of children and do not have the consent from the school or parents to agree to participate in the intervention. Larger groups in public spaces are also difficult to approach since they are focused on the school activity in hand. Street interventions also have a lot of elements of distraction so keeping activities short is essential. Role of parents: Parents act as both translators and facilitators for the exercise (for kids under 6 years old). In some cases they would translate from Catalan and Italian and help us engage children. When parents are present, it is best to approach them first. Consent forms and confidentiality: They didn\u2019t ask for a consent form (even though we bought ones with us) and were ok with us participating as long as they mediated the exercise. Correct age for intervention: While it was interesting to engage with parents and their young children, children under ages of 6 were too young for the type of reflections we needed. They only interpreted quite literally the images we showed them and had a difficult time building stories.This intervention in particular is most suited for children age 10 and above, they have greater critical thinking skills and can more easily make the connections between elements. We still have doubts regarding the artistic style / aesthetic style of the images and if words might be a better prompt. Role of weather and chosen time/date: When weather is too cold, rainy or gray there are less children outside. This seems obvious but influences also the openness of parents and children to participate and engage. Overall, this intervention made us reflect as a team that it would be best for these types of prompts to engage with teenagers since they can interpret things more abstract and in a less literal manner. Some other opportunity areas we identified are: What happens if we input the childrens\u2019 stories in Midjourney or Dall-E? How can we adapt the dynamic for different age ranges? For schools, we intend on keeping our initial target of 6-9 years old and adapt the dynamic for their age and for the setting. We intend to use the Design Dialogues as a first iteration of our prototype using cut outs from old magazines and making 2 sets of groups for the images: one for climate change and one for gender equality. We feel this activity might be more suitable for teenagers and adults but we are interested to see how people engage with the collages and what types of stories they build out.

Intervention 5 - Using GPT3 to imagine alternative use cases of conversational AI with Wen \u00b6 Me and Wen were both interested in the potential uses of GPT3. Inspired by this twitter thread, we set out to figure out how to configure the chat for these cases and build a quick user flow for a potential product related to this. We partnered up to create a first draft of a user navigation flow, system architecture and user persona setting. This was built over two weeks with the purpose of having a prototype that we could show on the Design Dialogues. This experiment related to my areas of interest as I saw an opportunity in being used for the healing stage in cases where people wanted to seek closure from potentially emotionally abusive or physically violent relationships but actually talking with the other person was not the best path. I input potential scenarios into GPT3 where men had been violent to their ex partners but where it was safer for them not to reach out to them personally in order to not interfere with their healing process. For this purpose I transcribed user interviews from previous projects. I tried to be as specific as possible, writing down phrases I had heard from previous projects and situations and recreated a potential dialogue where the man asks for forgiveness from his ex partner. Some early thoughts: User personas: - Victims of violence - receiving apologies and closure - Perpetrators of violence - apologizing and reaching out to victims Questions emerged: - Ethics - controlling addiction Who should use this tool? Therapists? When? - How can we make this accessible and scalable without going through therapists? - How can we use this as a storytelling tool? Mimic potential realistic dialogue between two characters that share a past story? We published this version on Behance to get reactions from users online and recruited users on our social media. We also created this Figma Landing site with all our initial learnings and this Figma Prototype with the most important screens. Wen during Design Dialogues showcasing a demo of our first prototype. How I would iterate the product moving forward: From: A tool for healing IPV by talking to someone you can\u2019t talk to in real life to: A tool for rehearsing hard conversations and detecting red flags and a tool to have conversations with yourself as a means of healing Specific use cases: - Handling break ups - Guiding new parents - Handling difficult conversations at work - Rehearsing conversations with your partner - Healing and asking for forgiveness to a younger self - Interactive journaling Before Design Dialogues I conducted 5 user tests with friends and family. You can check out the reactions here.","title":"Interventions and activities - First Trimester"},{"location":"project/03-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20First%20Trimester/#interventions-and-activities-first-trimester","text":"","title":"Interventions and activities - First Trimester"},{"location":"project/03-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20First%20Trimester/#intervention-1-mapping-the-ecosystem-in-barcelona-in-regards-to-gender","text":"Activities included: Interviewing key stakeholders (5) - Shemakes (Fab lab project) Femi\u00f1etas Sexus Loba Project (MDEF project) Lina from Fab lab My research started speaking to Lina, an audiovisual specialist at Fab Lab.

However, places of transit like streets or bus stops are not good because parents or teachers are more focused on mobility and getting their children safe and on time. Engaging teachers in public spaces is also not ideal since they are busy managing large groups of children and do not have the consent from the school or parents to agree to participate in the intervention. Larger groups in public spaces are also difficult to approach since they are focused on the school activity in hand. Street interventions also have a lot of elements of distraction so keeping activities short is essential. Role of parents: Parents act as both translators and facilitators for the exercise (for kids under 6 years old). In some cases they would translate from Catalan and Italian and help us engage children. When parents are present, it is best to approach them first. Consent forms and confidentiality: They didn\u2019t ask for a consent form (even though we bought ones with us) and were ok with us participating as long as they mediated the exercise. Correct age for intervention: While it was interesting to engage with parents and their young children, children under ages of 6 were too young for the type of reflections we needed. They only interpreted quite literally the images we showed them and had a difficult time building stories.This intervention in particular is most suited for children age 10 and above, they have greater critical thinking skills and can more easily make the connections between elements. We still have doubts regarding the artistic style / aesthetic style of the images and if words might be a better prompt. Role of weather and chosen time/date: When weather is too cold, rainy or gray there are less children outside. This seems obvious but influences also the openness of parents and children to participate and engage. Overall, this intervention made us reflect as a team that it would be best for these types of prompts to engage with teenagers since they can interpret things more abstract and in a less literal manner. Some other opportunity areas we identified are: What happens if we input the childrens\u2019 stories in Midjourney or Dall-E? How can we adapt the dynamic for different age ranges? For schools, we intend on keeping our initial target of 6-9 years old and adapt the dynamic for their age and for the setting. We intend to use the Design Dialogues as a first iteration of our prototype using cut outs from old magazines and making 2 sets of groups for the images: one for climate change and one for gender equality. We feel this activity might be more suitable for teenagers and adults but we are interested to see how people engage with the collages and what types of stories they build out.

Inspired by this twitter thread, we set out to figure out how to configure the chat for these cases and build a quick user flow for a potential product related to this. We partnered up to create a first draft of a user navigation flow, system architecture and user persona setting. This was built over two weeks with the purpose of having a prototype that we could show on the Design Dialogues. This experiment related to my areas of interest as I saw an opportunity in being used for the healing stage in cases where people wanted to seek closure from potentially emotionally abusive or physically violent relationships but actually talking with the other person was not the best path. I input potential scenarios into GPT3 where men had been violent to their ex partners but where it was safer for them not to reach out to them personally in order to not interfere with their healing process. For this purpose I transcribed user interviews from previous projects. I tried to be as specific as possible, writing down phrases I had heard from previous projects and situations and recreated a potential dialogue where the man asks for forgiveness from his ex partner. Some early thoughts: User personas: - Victims of violence - receiving apologies and closure - Perpetrators of violence - apologizing and reaching out to victims Questions emerged: - Ethics - controlling addiction Who should use this tool? Therapists? When? - How can we make this accessible and scalable without going through therapists? - How can we use this as a storytelling tool? Mimic potential realistic dialogue between two characters that share a past story? We published this version on Behance to get reactions from users online and recruited users on our social media. We also created this Figma Landing site with all our initial learnings and this Figma Prototype with the most important screens. Wen during Design Dialogues showcasing a demo of our first prototype. How I would iterate the product moving forward: From: A tool for healing IPV by talking to someone you can\u2019t talk to in real life to: A tool for rehearsing hard conversations and detecting red flags and a tool to have conversations with yourself as a means of healing Specific use cases: - Handling break ups - Guiding new parents - Handling difficult conversations at work - Rehearsing conversations with your partner - Healing and asking for forgiveness to a younger self - Interactive journaling Before Design Dialogues I conducted 5 user tests with friends and family.

Analyze your so-called \u201cfailures\u201d as opportunities for redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project accordingly. How has my project evolved? \u00b6 During the first trimester, I set out to map the gender / innovation / tech ecosystem in Barcelona, gather a community interested in deep diving on these subjects and conducting short and quick experiments both individually and collectively to identify connections both from a subject matter perspective to connecting with other peers in MDEF. After the first trimester I had 3 theories of change I wanted to deep dive further in: What if we imagined an automated chatbot that heals violent relationships and trauma? I learned that healing using GPT3 can sit within ethical borders and it is best to use this technology for actual conversations that will indeed happen in the future. ie. Helping someone practice for a break-up conversation, using chat as a means to teach people about non-violent communication. What if we actively fought gender bias and harassment through machine generated imagery and words? For this one, I wrote a medium article and shared it on my newsletter. While I feel it is a great opportunity area, I feel generating feminist data sets will be a bit too time-consuming considering the time frames of the Master so will put this one on hold. What if we co-created future visions on gender equality with children? I will run a workshop with 75 9-year old children in a school in Badalona with Ariel and Wen. The objective is to use these imagined futures as a means to work towards those goals for the rest of my interventions. Arising opportunity areas: \u00b6 These are 2 areas I will deep dive in this second trimester. What if we co-created future visions on ecofeminism with migrant women? This can shift power balance, allow them to discover their voices and be an introduction towards developing a futures literacy muscle. What if we taught non-violent communication through micro digital stories for children? New project goals \u00b6 While I feel my areas of interest and weak signals have not changed, process-wise I am learning to flow more freely and let myself be swept away by potential collaborations that may emerge even if they don\u2019t fit precisely into my original ideas. I also plan on using interventions as a way to gain insights rather than as a means to designing a final product or service. The interventions for the following month are as follows: Deep dive on collage-creation workshop with Ariel and Wen My intention in this intervention is to use the end results imagined by children as starting points for my experiments for a final project. What futures do children imagine in relation to gender equality and ecofeminism? Intervention with Carolina on futures literacy with migrant women. We intend to give voice to women in vulnerable situations through a collage exercise to capture ancestral knowledge and think of ways of documenting beyond texts and verbal language. Personal project - Online open-source glossary on gender-related terminology and/or micro digital storybooks to teach children Non-Violent Communication Personal project - AI chatbot to help men and women navigate difficult conversations Iteration of Innerbot (from first trimester) and content curated by a Non Violent Communication expert. Some scripts to explore for chatbot: Rehearsing a couples\u2019 negotiation Talking about couple finances Women asking for a raise Simulating a break up Helping fathers have healthy communication with their children For pushing this project forward my next steps will be contacting Taller Estampa for technical help and playing with chat GPT3 to emulate the scenarios. After having an initial prototype, I will seek the aid of a Nonviolent Communication expert and a GBV expert. Intervention 1 Second Trimester- Imagining futures with children \u00b6 Workshop plan \u00b6 We will do a school intervention with 75 9-year old children in Sant Andreu school in Badalona. The activity is divided into 3 classes of approx. 20 children (75 children in total). For us to implement this workshop we had to leverage the trust Xavi and Fab Lab team had already created with schools in Badalona and had to email the Principal and key coordinators for over 2 months. It is hard to schedule activities with children since they need to be integrated into key dates of the academic calendars. Co-creation process \u00b6 For the co-creation process, we first built on the findings from the public parks interventions and design dialogues from Trimester I. Mariana gave us some insights and guidelines to approach the intervention in this second round. We visited the school on Wednesday to co-create with the tutor and ask her relevant content questions, how the exercise fits with the regular curricula and what we can change to create more engagement with the children. We decided to ask children more specific questions - i.e. how do you imagine zoos of the future? or parks of the future? or schools of the future? or sports of the future? as opposed to a general \u201cHow do you imagine the future?\u201d question. This specificity will help them be much more concrete with their answers which is rich input for us as designers. As mentioned above, trust building with schools was done through Xavi\u2019s Fab Lab network and took a couple of months to actually schedule the activity. Since schools have to provide a uniform experience for all children in one grade, we needed to replicate the activity with all 75 students and had to run a pretty big pilot. We decided to start off with only one class and then iterate the activity for the remaining 2 classes. 1 st intervention with 24 children \u00b6 Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 20 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 24 children The workshop lasted 45 minutes. The teachers were very open to what we proposed and actually felt they couldn\u2019t interrupt our session. Children were very happy and motivated by our presence. We documented photos, videos and voice recordings but were careful to take pictures of their individual faces because of child protection laws. One thing we noticed we could improve was help teachers feel more involved with the activity. We felt that teachers felt they could take a break and rest from their busy schedules but were also very interested and curious of the content. Incorporating teachers more actively can be something we can improve later on. In preparation for the activity, we designed a short presentation that would serve as an introduction (who we are, our backgrounds, where we come from and introduction to climate change and gender equality). You can check the attached presentation here with our group findings You can hear some of their stories from this session here. Mapped improvements for next iterations: \u00b6 Show collage cutouts later since children are easily distracted. Once they saw the collage cut outs they stopped thinking of the futures and focused more on the images themselves. Spend a bit more time on introduction, asking them questions about the topic area and having a horizontal conversation. They are very young so they are more interested in animals than in humans. They do not comprehend very much gender inequality. It is a very complex subject for them so it would be best to talk about inclusion in general. Teachers are willing to do more activities with them and use innovative tools in their classes. This can also be an opportunity to onboard teachers on new tools and exercises. Teachers want to participate too! and design their futures. First teacher imagined a school with modular furniture that quickly transformed into different settings for diverse learning styles. Children are happy to help us imagine futures and enthusiastic about welcoming new people into their classrooms. Childrens\u2019 imagined futures grouped thematically: \u00b6 Parks: New animal species. Animals, fruits and no cars so animals are not scared, vet in parks. Pokemons are part of parks. Schools: Poor children are fed in schools, bread to feed everyone in schools. Zoos: Punishing people that kill animals by making them go to jail, animal protection. No zoos, animals free to roam around. People in charge of animal rescue. Animals are trained to become stronger so we can live with wild animals and feed them, live with them without killing others. Where you can be friends with animals and they are not hunted. Sports: Each person chooses their uniform, their way to express themselves. In one same area all sports can be held in the same area, it can be transformed for different sports. Emerging insights from this first intervention: \u00b6 Better futures for children are more inclusive futures and non-humans are very included. Mindful of eating, nourishment, especially for poor children. Children imagine better futures in regards to inclusion more than inequality, ie. letting all animals be in a zoo, letting everyone participate in sports, no uniforms, letting everyone express themselves freely. Sidenote: Children associate \u201cpoor\u201d people with racial diversity. Children have a hard time also reflecting on their own school experience and prefer to design for children from lower income families. My personal takeaways on how this intervention relates to emerging visions on gender equality: \u00b6 Children have a hard time imagining gender equality since they are unaware of how society impacts human beings differently according to gender. However children can imagine and imagine a world with more inclusion. This looks like olympics and soccer matches for all ages and all genders, where uniform is a personal choice of expression. Some visions children imagined: \u00b6 Household tasks are distributed equally Interspecies schooling Housing for everyone Places of repair and healing in public spaces This allows us to build a future where preservation and care are pillars in equality and inclusion. Some emerging results from our first iteration in Badalona below. Video with stories imagined by childrens PDF we shared with teachers to schedule the activity. Learnings from doing a first prototype in parks. 2 nd intervention with 50 children \u00b6 Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 27 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 50 children (2 classes) The workshop will be almost identical with the previous one with some changes. The children will imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. For this second iteration of intervention with children, we decided to not show the collage cut outs from the start and to let the children spend more time ideating and focusing on crafting more compelling stories. We allowed them to use color pencils and crayons and not to focus on using cut outs from magazines. This second iteration gave us the following results: \u00b6 After we introduced the collage cut outs, no children used the cut outs anymore. We realized they were more distracting than adding to the experience. What you show at first is crucial for children since it is what they will focus their attention on. Children spent more time collaborating and listening to their peers when they didn\u2019t have distracting elements. The end stories were more reflexive and of higher quality this time around. With the collage in the first iteration, they struggled incorporating all the elements and with no collages being shown, they could focus on their stories and adding details to the stories. Question for future iterations: If we choose not to use collage anymore, what would be the minimum viable prompts we would need to give children for better stories and more engagement? Is the template with the backdrop enough or is there any other element we can incorporate that adds to the experience? Some insights from the second iteration: \u00b6 Content-wise, children are overall optimistic and positive about the future. Some emerging themes from this session: Redistribution of wealth (ie. feeding the poor, free housing for the poor) Inclusion (ie. Sports for all ages and all genders) Freedom (ie. Abolishing zoos) Diversity (ie. New species, interspecies schools) Some emerging results from the second iteration in Badalona in the following link. We received the feedback from faculty to make the workshop more participatory in the sense that children are given increased agency, new facilitation roles and we let go of control to see where the activity takes us and how this can influence their imagined futures. We will also talk to a school psychologist for a future iteration. Ask ourselves, how can this feel co-created rather than imposed? Perception Board (developed during First Fab Lab Challenge) \u00b6 This week I worked with Ariel and Wen to develop a physical product that would allow us to engage with children\u2019s perceptions in relation to 3 different fields: climate change, gender equality and mental health. We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incorporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them.

We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive. Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers. These types of tools can be easily scaled to schools and taught to teachers to implement in classrooms. We hope this can be a low-tech analog way of fighting back filter bubbles in digital social media, allowing and welcoming difference of thought. Incorporating a Speaker Mic to the Perception Board \u00b6 This week I worked with Wen and Ariel on designing a complementary product that would amplify the experience of using our Perception Board. While we haven\u2019t had the time and space to test with school students, we still wanted to iterate on the experience to test with both teachers and students during the Third Trimester. For this challenge, we had to incorporate 3D printing, CNC and sensors. This is why we designed a Speaker Mic that would have the objective of helping define who speaks during a classroom session and can design a small ritual around that moment. Some learnings during this challenge listed below: Fabrication processes take a lot of time and efficient time planning is mandatory. During challenges and when working with time constraints, it is best to align fast and then iterate and add more complex systems to the design. Only the 3D printing took over 18 hours. While most processes are digitally fabricated, manual work is very important for incorporating systems and to make sure final adjustments are done correctly. We had to sand manually, put nails on the 3D printed microphone and make a cardboard box by hand to make sure everything worked correctly at the end. Testing with users the final system is equally as important . While these production weeks focused on fabrication help us design the system, it is also important to go back to our communities and test the product and system with them. We are planning on going back to classrooms to test both the perception board and our speaker mics. Incorporate electronics meaningfully. While we can be very drawn to using electronics playfully and introducing a lot of sensors, we chose to make the interaction as simple as possible. This is because using the board in itself is quite complex for children and electronics should help them understand what action is required from them. Building fast allows you to gain a full picture of the system We were happy to see how our Board was nicely integrated at the end with all the elements. This weeks allow us to move forward and not think too much on the design. This I feel was good because it helped us think of the system as a whole and integrating it with the user experience as fast as possible. One of the feedback we received from Santi was that our classmates gathered around when we showed our artifact which we can take as a positive signal that high school students might be equally as engaged. Project repo Design Dialogues Term 2 \u00b6 I used the Design Dialogues space during March 22 nd as a way to gather feedback primarily on the Perception Board and the Speaker Mic. Overall we were prompted to go test with students because while we may be receiving helpful suggestions, we will never know how they react to the product until we test it out on a classroom. Some of the feedback we received listed below: Circularity and sustainability are topics teachers want and need to address in today\u2019s classroom Try product with smaller groups (max. 10 students) The future is fluid so make sure prompts are flexible and do not reflect a particular political point of view Maybe think of narratives rather than solutions Pointers may be personalized by the children themselves before using them How do we incorporate principles of Non Violent Communication into the process of using the tools we designed? i.e. Respect everyone\u2019s turn Explore \u201curgent\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d as dimensions for the board Change the design of the board to make it more transport-friendly (i.e. foldable Monopoly board) Intervention 2 Second Trimester - Exploring futures literacy with Mam\u00e1s que leen \u00b6 Workshop plan \u00b6 We started with the initial idea of using collage as a means to empower migrant women and explore futures literacy as a skillset that can be actively developed. After feedback from Tom\u00e1s we decided our engagement strategy would first be have casual conversations with potential communities and organizations and then see which ones are relevant to work with and to generate trust for greater horizontality in the intervention. We decided to reach out to 3 communities: Open Cultural Center Mam\u00e1s que leen Periferias cimarronas After that process we picked the community that was most enthusiastic about collaborating with us: Mam\u00e1s que leen. This document reflects our initial point of view on what the workshop would look like. Trust building - Attending classes before implementing the workshop \u00b6 Me and Carolina went to Mamas que leen on January 24 th to meet Karin the founder, get to know the classes and the location. We left feeling super inspired and they offered 2 1-hour sessions for us to conduct the ecofeminism collage intervention. Some highlights and first impressions from this first visit: The female environment of women teaching women and supporting each other. The huge stigma migration is in Europe and how aggressive it is and how it impacts these women. Their relation to nature before and after migration. The financial struggles of the organization as they seek support from ayuntamiento but receive little funding because Spanish is the language being taught (not Catalan). Latin American women offering themselves as volunteers (from Chile, Peru, Mexico). Potential of future literacy and collage being a third / fourth / fifth language in the room. We are happy that Tom\u00e1s advised us to first blend in and get to know the group. We plan on attending a couple of lessons before implementing the workshop. Frugality. Their lack of knowledge on geography is an opportunity for us to also print maps of their countries (Bangladesh, Morocco and Pakistan). Karin, the founder, suggested we incorporate a vision board so they can reflect about their dreams, goals and hopes. First class we attended at Mamas que Leen - 3 rd February \u00b6 Diary entry: \u201cI went to Mamas que Leen with Carolina. We arrived a bit late and there were only 3 students, Karin and 1 volunteer in the class. They mentioned that there were many students missing because their children had fallen sick with the flu. They were reading a short story as a group with Karin and then Karin gave us a fun game with rolling dice to co-create stories as a group. It felt nice just to spend time with them, getting to know them and them familiarizing with us. We still need to think about the workshop itself, but I am learning that building confidence is just as important for these types of interventions.\u201d Second class we attended at Mamas que Leen - 7 th February \u00b6 Diary entry: \u201cWe arrived on time this time and introduced ourselves to the whole group. They were reading a short story collectively and I was surprised by the trust and humor of the environment. Karin is very good at asking questions and getting the women interested in the texts they are reading.\u201d Applying to Fem Fabrik \u00b6 We co-created a workshop with Carolina and are applying to Fem Fabrik in La Clandestina to see if we can showcase the end result of our workshop with Mamas que leen in a full-day event held for women artists on Saturday 11 th of March. Our shift in the workshop design is to use inputs from female poets that also allude to nature and use that as a starting point to discuss ecofeminism. We chose this because we feel this is a less academic point of view and we can use the poems as an input to highlight keywords and co-create a collective map for the second session. We were selected to Fem Fabrik but were asked to clarify a bit more our intentions. We will be given a 1x1 exhibit space and we are thinking of adapting the format of the fanzine to fit the vertical space we have been assigned. We also need to verify with Karin, founder of Mam\u00e1s que leen, if our participation is ok by her. Workshop prep \u00b6 We made collaborative Google Slides files to crowdsource images for the collage then prepared the file for printing at Elisava. We used bond paper and tried to align aesthetically all the images while allowing for randomness in the content area to emerge. We also curated 5 different poems from female authors that would be talking points to start discussing ecofeminism. We sent our workshop structure to Karin via email to gather her reactions. You can read the workshop structure here. This document reflects our workshop structure. Workshop - 2 sessions \u00b6 Workshop day 1 - February 23 rd Participants: 9 women 2 volunteers + Karin (Javiera and Maria Jose) We held the first session of the 2-day workshop today. We used the session to build trust and introduce the subject matter on ecofeminism. The session involved introducing the them then reading out loud 4 different poems from The Intersectional Environmentalist, Rupi Kaur and Maya Angelou. There was some area for improvement and some highlights listed below. Highlights: It was great to build on existing behaviors, such as reading texts out loud Showing vulnerability ourselves and personal stories is key to creating a safe space. Building trust to later ask them to write words on their own maternal tongues was also important. Creating poems that are short and easy to understand is key. Karin\u2019s role is vital. She already has trust with them and can dig deeper or get them to participate more. There were some very deep discussions around etymologies of words, such as \u201ccapullo\u201d or \u201ckaur\u201d. Everyone sharing how they say specific words in their own maternal tongue was also a special moment in the dynamic. They\u2019ve never done collage before so they are looking forward to the crafts moment. One personal learning for me was to not over plan the actual workshop and allow for improvisation and for things not being perfect. While this is our first collage intervention we still have time to do a different version with the same community and they are not expecting perfection out of our workshop with them. They are valuing the time and effort we are investing in them and the possibility of learning a new craft and that is something we should honor. Improvements: Space arrangement. We did not have the time or freedom to make a circular space. Asking them how they are feeling didn\u2019t work because of the space arrangement and also felt forced. We could\u2019ve explained what is a collage earlier on for greater clarity. We needed to print more copies of the poems so they could take home. Tomorrow I am looking forward to getting our hands dirty and making the collages. 24 th February Second day collage creation Workshop day 2 - February 24 th Participants: 6 women 1 volunteer Today was the second day of the collage creation workshop at Mam\u00e1s que Leen. We felt much more confident and less nervous this second time even though we had a few material constraints (forgot to bring more scissors, didn\u2019t cut the paper that we were using as base previously). The women also felt much more comfortable participating (one chose to carry on learning Spanish) and the other 6 attendants joined the collage creation. None of them had ever done a collage before and it felt like the appropriate art technique to imagine futures and relations with words. Each woman picked a set of 2 words from the poems we had read out loud the previous day. Some word combinations that were chosen \u201ctranquilidad + calma\u201d, \u201cpoder + cuidado\u201d, \u201cabuelos amor\u201d. Carolina spoke a blend of Portuguese + Spanish and to me that also set the perfect tone since we wanted to create a space of vulnerability, showing how we are all migrants in Spain and how we are all here to learn. We struggled with the space setting since we didn\u2019t want to be placed in a hierarchically higher position than them. Quite the contrary, we wanted to learn from them and hear what they had to say. They started cutting some of the images they picked and with very little needed guidance they each made their own collage. It was beautiful to see their creations. They also were very happy to learn that we would scan them and place the collages in a fanzine. These are the words each participant chose: Karin (fundadora) - Esfuerzo, cambios Khadiza - Tierra, poder Souad - Abuela, ciudado, amor Lina - Poder, Protecci\u00f3n, Placer, Capacidad, Comenzar, Poder Kazi Sonia Alam - Poder, Cuidado Kulwinder Kaur - Plantas y jard\u00edn Bouchra - tranquilidad y paz Materials we printed and used Documented audio files from both days. Karin the founder gave us tulips as a gift for doing the workshop and each participant wrote out our names in their mother tongue. We honestly felt so grateful and that we were receiving much more than we were giving to them. For me it was one of those moments were I felt blessed to be part of something and that I would be willing to repeat this activity even if I were not part of MDEF. When we were walking back home, me and Carolina talked about this feeling of us receiving so much more than we gave and also how these communities that are bottom up are usually much more generous than other more formal ones. We questioned how we can design experiences or interventions where the facilitators (us) are not gaining more out of the exchange. This may benefit our academic careers and help us generate design knowledge, but what we have given to them is enough? We personally feel we are gaining more. Carolina put down our thoughts quite beautifully on her Instagram story. Mamas que leen is an association that teaches immigrant women in El Raval how to read and write in Spanish. We did a co-design exercise on the connection between nature and women. A moment to defy the status quo of the daily life and imagine ecofeminist futures. We learned much more from them than they learned from us. The exchange was not equal. And we are trying to learn how we can build spaces where the exchange of knowledge draws from both sides equally (facilitator and participants). In the photo I am in a different baseline, we tried to diffuse this physical difference (that so often penetrates the perception of someone) by sitting down during the workshop and sharing our own experiences on the different topics. Our role there was not the role of the teacher. It was not easy as the structures of a hierarchy based education (top-down) are deeply infiltrated into everything, from mindsets, table arrangements to available space to freely move and defy stillness. We were struggling to adapt our methods to a space that was created for strict teaching structures. By trying to imagine this new futures we were seeing the present struggles more thoughtfully. To me one of the takeaways was also how to honor that beautiful space that is Mam\u00e1s que Leen. If we were to turn this into a language learning app all the beauty and meaningfulness of the space would be lost. I think the women there value the horizontal space with other women, the cultural and language exchange and also the rich debates they have on topics related to feminism, women\u2019s rights, sexual education. I was pleasantly surprised as to how Karin talks with ease about these subjects with them without imposing her point of view and how these important subjects emerge just on day-to-day Spanish lessons. I hope Mam\u00e1s que leen continues as a space next trimester to see how our intervention can evolve. Me and Carolina were also discussing how we are both interesting in the financial side of supporting these organizations. Can we find ways to help Karin find volunteers? Can we amplify the stories of these women and in turn help them generate financial funds to keep going? FemFabrik \u00b6 Me and Carolina started working on the exhibition for FemFabrik. We wanted to give space to the collages and not to overdesign what is around them. We designed a mock up of what the structure would look like and using Fab lab materials (cardbooard and vinyl cutting). This is what our design looks like. Material prep for Fem Fabrik \u00b6 We experienced a few setbacks during the production and set up of our exhibition because there was an error in scheduling MDEF courses that week. This meant we were only left with Friday afternoon for laser cutting, vinyl cutting and printing. While we were initially frustrated, we managed to iterate the design, set up the files in Rhino and have everything ready for the event. Fem Fabrik - March 11 th \u00b6 On Saturday morning we arrived to have all the materials set up during the event. It was sunny and windy, which meant we struggled with setting up the exhibit space but were finally successful. I found it was a very inspiring event, focused on women and non-binary humans. The energy felt alive in the event and many assistants reached out to us to find out more about the interventions. They also found the collages to be quite beautiful. This was a key moment for us to share back our reactions from the intervention and also help Mamas que Leen reach a bigger audience. We shared photos with Mamas que leen so they could also share on their own social media channels. The main takeaway of the event for me was that this intervention was the only one that addressed women in vulnerable situations and from non European countries. The assistants to the event we talked to were intrigued by the collage results and also started a debate about women\u2019s rights in the SWANA region. Representing the voices of all women is important, especially of those that cannot afford the time and space to attend these types of events. We were particularly cautious of not making our voices be more important than those of las \u201cMam\u00e1s que leen\u201d, which is why the collages were at the forefront of the exhibition space. See a compilation of the collages in PDF. We also made them mobile phone wallpapers. Other activities explored - NonViolent Communication course, salary negotiation experiment and Bologna\u2019s Children Book Fair \u00b6 NonViolent Communication Course at Horta Guinard\u00f3 \u00b6 On January 10 th I attended a Non Violent Communication Course I found through Meetup. My intention was to know more about the methodology and engage with experts that could help me develop a chatbot that uses GPT-3 to heal violent relationships and trauma. I was surprised at the amount of men that were there hoping to have healthier relationships not only with their partners but in general. Mixed crowd, 30-40 range Conducted by expert on NVC and on hiking (2 people) !5 people attended Mixed backgrounds, some were football coaches, consultants. There were 2 men willing to unlearn biases and willing to manage their tempers. They organize 2 day retreats in nature Workshop takeaways: Content itself - very useful and interesting tips to apply in daily life Importance of relation to nature when wanting to unlearn violence Importance of finding strategies that best suit yourself Amount of people interested and willing to learn more, older age too Naming emotions as an exercise and exerting control over your own reactions as one of the keys to Non Violent Communication. More space and time needed for more depth. Exploring GPT3 to combat gender inequality (healing trauma and salary negotiations) \u00b6 For this exploration I will be working with Paula. Paula is an amazing Design Lead with background in political sciences that has worked in initiatives to prevent sexual harassment and to financially empower women through microloans. We will be playing remotely with Chat GPT3 to explore alternative uses of this technology and suggest how this technology can also be better used, considering ethical constraints. I had a co-creating design session with Paula on February 3 rd . We are interested in developing some type of product with a gender lens. You can check out this initial presentation with our emerging ideas. We explored using chat GPT3 for rehearsing important conversations. Some initial learnings from our exploration: Chat GPT3 is not good at providing information beyond what is inputted. Does not offer skills for managing conversations Some interesting findings when inputting CVs with job descriptions Can write cover letters Can outline talking points to make a convincing argument Focus on salary negotiations might be a good starting point considering limitations of the tool You can input performance reviews, emails from bosses, chat conversations We will launch a quick survey to gather ideas on what makes a good salary negotiation. For the survey, I designed an airtable form linked to an airtable gallery card view to enable users to submit answers but also to openly visualize other users\u2019 responses. This is a first probe to see if people are willing to share salary increases publicly and openly, and to see if this is a tool they may also use in these types of negotiations. After publicly sharing the link on Linkedin, with personal colleagues and with communities of designers in Latin America, our next iteration will be to recommend Chat GPT3 use cases to have actual conversations around salary increase with their employers. Even though in my conversation with Tomas he mentioned to just deploy fast and maybe move on to a new experiment, I feel there is potential in these types of tools around salary negotiations, transparency and the potential for financial power being transferred back to women. What do next steps for this look like? Measure traction of surveys and analyze patterns in data (what makes a good salary negotiation?) Share GPT3 tools with community You can see the results we got in this table. The release of the survey allowed me to craft these early insights: A lot of women realized they had never negotiated a salary before so they could not answer the survey. Many men and women are scared of answering surveys because they might lose their job if the employer finds out. Salary negotiation is not only taboo but is also penalized. Women that did fill out the form had to design \u201chacks\u201d to get their salary to be fair and readjusted. i.e. talk about type of contract, ask current employees on Linkedin. Companies lie during the process and don\u2019t disclose salaries. Some opportunity areas: Design for hacks? While tech can help, negotiating salaries has to do with managing culture, making allies and engaging key people in the org to support your raise. I chose to keep this intervention on standby to focus on the other two, but I may resume it in the last trimester. Bologna Book Fair \u00b6 As an early activity to explore my interest in children\u2019s books as a means to actively imagine the future with them, I attended the Bologna Book Fair with Wen as illustrators from March 6 th to 8 th . We also participated by submitting our personal illustrations on the Virtual Illustrators Wall. However, our focus was to be absorbed by the event itself and understand the publishing side of the business and get familiar with editorials all over the world. Some emerging learnings for me were: The emerging genre of silent books (or wordless books) Visual narratives that need no translators as they are designed to be understood without the use of words. Beautiful concept when thinking of imaging futures beyond language. Emotional regulation and soft skills as key themes Children are being actively taught to cope with difficult emotions and are no longer taboo. Alzheimers, depression, grief, war and even rape are some of the subject matters for children\u2019s books. This was surprising to me because when I was younger these are topics that maybe TV shows for teenagers would target but never a cultural product designed for children. Women\u2019s representation - As the event coincided with March 8 th , there was a dedicated section devoted to engaging women in publishers and representing women in different lenses. LGBTQ representation, gender fluidity. These concepts are no longer taboo in certain European countries, though not the case for Asian, Easter and Latin American countries. Using children\u2019s books to talk about tough subjects, build bridges beyond language, engage children with the full human experience. Exploring alternative presents \u00b6 Having absorbed the content from the Futures Talks, as well as my interventions for this second trimester, I feel an overall arch that unites these is using futures literacy with an ecofeminist lens. Solving gender inequalities is actually one of the most effective ways to help combat global warming, and notions of femininity and how it links to our perception of the Earth also relates to how we as humans are damaging the environment. It is quite difficult to separate these concepts and while I was initially not particularly interested in focusing on environment and ecologies, I have found myself immersed in this subject. In relation to the ways of drifting, I feel this Trimester I have had an expansive and a probing approach. Expansive because I have deliberately linked all my interventions to gender equality and probing because I have also allowed myself to flow and find interconnections with my classmates, even pushing some interventions that are more artistic (like the one I did with Carolina and Mam\u00e1s que Leen). Due to this shift in my thinking, I have outlined an alternative present below. Present continuities Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) don\u2019t have allocated time, space or skills to actively imagine future scenarios that are optimistic and also daring. Crafting futures is typically reserved to spaces dominated by capitalist logics of extraction and exclusively reserved to privileged humans that have the space and time to monetize efforts to predict the future, without taking into consideration planetary wellbeing (ecologies) or even the desire and needs of minorities (or feminist perspectives). Alternative present Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) have the tools, skills and designated spaces to not only imagine but actively co-create futures with an ecofeminist perspective. Building futures is an active ongoing exercise that exists in education spaces, inside homes and in social gatherings through collage creation, story building and participatory games that welcome differences of perception and thought. This helps combat echo chambers and filter bubbles since the futures are created welcoming and exploring the complex nuances of difference of thought.","title":"Interventions and activities - Second Trimester"},{"location":"project/04-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20Second%20Trimester/#design-studio-second-trimester","text":"Assignment: Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back.

After the first trimester I had 3 theories of change I wanted to deep dive further in: What if we imagined an automated chatbot that heals violent relationships and trauma? I learned that healing using GPT3 can sit within ethical borders and it is best to use this technology for actual conversations that will indeed happen in the future. ie. Helping someone practice for a break-up conversation, using chat as a means to teach people about non-violent communication. What if we actively fought gender bias and harassment through machine generated imagery and words? For this one, I wrote a medium article and shared it on my newsletter. While I feel it is a great opportunity area, I feel generating feminist data sets will be a bit too time-consuming considering the time frames of the Master so will put this one on hold. What if we co-created future visions on gender equality with children? I will run a workshop with 75 9-year old children in a school in Badalona with Ariel and Wen.

We visited the school on Wednesday to co-create with the tutor and ask her relevant content questions, how the exercise fits with the regular curricula and what we can change to create more engagement with the children. We decided to ask children more specific questions - i.e. how do you imagine zoos of the future? or parks of the future? or schools of the future? or sports of the future? as opposed to a general \u201cHow do you imagine the future?\u201d question. This specificity will help them be much more concrete with their answers which is rich input for us as designers. As mentioned above, trust building with schools was done through Xavi\u2019s Fab Lab network and took a couple of months to actually schedule the activity.

We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incorporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them.

We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive. Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers. These types of tools can be easily scaled to schools and taught to teachers to implement in classrooms. We hope this can be a low-tech analog way of fighting back filter bubbles in digital social media, allowing and welcoming difference of thought.","title":"Perception Board (developed during First Fab Lab Challenge)"},{"location":"project/04-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20Second%20Trimester/#incorporating-a-speaker-mic-to-the-perception-board","text":"This week I worked with Wen and Ariel on designing a complementary product that would amplify the experience of using our Perception Board. While we haven\u2019t had the time and space to test with school students, we still wanted to iterate on the experience to test with both teachers and students during the Third Trimester. For this challenge, we had to incorporate 3D printing, CNC and sensors. This is why we designed a Speaker Mic that would have the objective of helping define who speaks during a classroom session and can design a small ritual around that moment. Some learnings during this challenge listed below: Fabrication processes take a lot of time and efficient time planning is mandatory. During challenges and when working with time constraints, it is best to align fast and then iterate and add more complex systems to the design. Only the 3D printing took over 18 hours. While most processes are digitally fabricated, manual work is very important for incorporating systems and to make sure final adjustments are done correctly. We had to sand manually, put nails on the 3D printed microphone and make a cardboard box by hand to make sure everything worked correctly at the end. Testing with users the final system is equally as important . While these production weeks focused on fabrication help us design the system, it is also important to go back to our communities and test the product and system with them. We are planning on going back to classrooms to test both the perception board and our speaker mics. Incorporate electronics meaningfully. While we can be very drawn to using electronics playfully and introducing a lot of sensors, we chose to make the interaction as simple as possible. This is because using the board in itself is quite complex for children and electronics should help them understand what action is required from them. Building fast allows you to gain a full picture of the system We were happy to see how our Board was nicely integrated at the end with all the elements. This weeks allow us to move forward and not think too much on the design. This I feel was good because it helped us think of the system as a whole and integrating it with the user experience as fast as possible. One of the feedback we received from Santi was that our classmates gathered around when we showed our artifact which we can take as a positive signal that high school students might be equally as engaged.

Our shift in the workshop design is to use inputs from female poets that also allude to nature and use that as a starting point to discuss ecofeminism. We chose this because we feel this is a less academic point of view and we can use the poems as an input to highlight keywords and co-create a collective map for the second session. We were selected to Fem Fabrik but were asked to clarify a bit more our intentions. We will be given a 1x1 exhibit space and we are thinking of adapting the format of the fanzine to fit the vertical space we have been assigned.

We used the session to build trust and introduce the subject matter on ecofeminism. The session involved introducing the them then reading out loud 4 different poems from The Intersectional Environmentalist, Rupi Kaur and Maya Angelou. There was some area for improvement and some highlights listed below. Highlights: It was great to build on existing behaviors, such as reading texts out loud Showing vulnerability ourselves and personal stories is key to creating a safe space. Building trust to later ask them to write words on their own maternal tongues was also important. Creating poems that are short and easy to understand is key. Karin\u2019s role is vital. She already has trust with them and can dig deeper or get them to participate more. There were some very deep discussions around etymologies of words, such as \u201ccapullo\u201d or \u201ckaur\u201d. Everyone sharing how they say specific words in their own maternal tongue was also a special moment in the dynamic. They\u2019ve never done collage before so they are looking forward to the crafts moment. One personal learning for me was to not over plan the actual workshop and allow for improvisation and for things not being perfect. While this is our first collage intervention we still have time to do a different version with the same community and they are not expecting perfection out of our workshop with them. They are valuing the time and effort we are investing in them and the possibility of learning a new craft and that is something we should honor. Improvements: Space arrangement. We did not have the time or freedom to make a circular space. Asking them how they are feeling didn\u2019t work because of the space arrangement and also felt forced. We could\u2019ve explained what is a collage earlier on for greater clarity. We needed to print more copies of the poems so they could take home. Tomorrow I am looking forward to getting our hands dirty and making the collages. 24 th February Second day collage creation Workshop day 2 - February 24 th Participants: 6 women 1 volunteer Today was the second day of the collage creation workshop at Mam\u00e1s que Leen. We felt much more confident and less nervous this second time even though we had a few material constraints (forgot to bring more scissors, didn\u2019t cut the paper that we were using as base previously). The women also felt much more comfortable participating (one chose to carry on learning Spanish) and the other 6 attendants joined the collage creation. None of them had ever done a collage before and it felt like the appropriate art technique to imagine futures and relations with words. Each woman picked a set of 2 words from the poems we had read out loud the previous day. Some word combinations that were chosen \u201ctranquilidad + calma\u201d, \u201cpoder + cuidado\u201d, \u201cabuelos amor\u201d. Carolina spoke a blend of Portuguese + Spanish and to me that also set the perfect tone since we wanted to create a space of vulnerability, showing how we are all migrants in Spain and how we are all here to learn. We struggled with the space setting since we didn\u2019t want to be placed in a hierarchically higher position than them. Quite the contrary, we wanted to learn from them and hear what they had to say. They started cutting some of the images they picked and with very little needed guidance they each made their own collage. It was beautiful to see their creations. They also were very happy to learn that we would scan them and place the collages in a fanzine. These are the words each participant chose: Karin (fundadora) - Esfuerzo, cambios Khadiza - Tierra, poder Souad - Abuela, ciudado, amor Lina - Poder, Protecci\u00f3n, Placer, Capacidad, Comenzar, Poder Kazi Sonia Alam - Poder, Cuidado Kulwinder Kaur - Plantas y jard\u00edn Bouchra - tranquilidad y paz Materials we printed and used Documented audio files from both days. Karin the founder gave us tulips as a gift for doing the workshop and each participant wrote out our names in their mother tongue. We honestly felt so grateful and that we were receiving much more than we were giving to them. For me it was one of those moments were I felt blessed to be part of something and that I would be willing to repeat this activity even if I were not part of MDEF. When we were walking back home, me and Carolina talked about this feeling of us receiving so much more than we gave and also how these communities that are bottom up are usually much more generous than other more formal ones. We questioned how we can design experiences or interventions where the facilitators (us) are not gaining more out of the exchange. This may benefit our academic careers and help us generate design knowledge, but what we have given to them is enough? We personally feel we are gaining more. Carolina put down our thoughts quite beautifully on her Instagram story. Mamas que leen is an association that teaches immigrant women in El Raval how to read and write in Spanish. We did a co-design exercise on the connection between nature and women. A moment to defy the status quo of the daily life and imagine ecofeminist futures. We learned much more from them than they learned from us. The exchange was not equal. And we are trying to learn how we can build spaces where the exchange of knowledge draws from both sides equally (facilitator and participants). In the photo I am in a different baseline, we tried to diffuse this physical difference (that so often penetrates the perception of someone) by sitting down during the workshop and sharing our own experiences on the different topics. Our role there was not the role of the teacher. It was not easy as the structures of a hierarchy based education (top-down) are deeply infiltrated into everything, from mindsets, table arrangements to available space to freely move and defy stillness. We were struggling to adapt our methods to a space that was created for strict teaching structures. By trying to imagine this new futures we were seeing the present struggles more thoughtfully. To me one of the takeaways was also how to honor that beautiful space that is Mam\u00e1s que Leen. If we were to turn this into a language learning app all the beauty and meaningfulness of the space would be lost. I think the women there value the horizontal space with other women, the cultural and language exchange and also the rich debates they have on topics related to feminism, women\u2019s rights, sexual education. I was pleasantly surprised as to how Karin talks with ease about these subjects with them without imposing her point of view and how these important subjects emerge just on day-to-day Spanish lessons. I hope Mam\u00e1s que leen continues as a space next trimester to see how our intervention can evolve. Me and Carolina were also discussing how we are both interesting in the financial side of supporting these organizations. Can we find ways to help Karin find volunteers? Can we amplify the stories of these women and in turn help them generate financial funds to keep going?","title":"Workshop - 2 sessions"},{"location":"project/04-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20Second%20Trimester/#femfabrik","text":"Me and Carolina started working on the exhibition for FemFabrik.

This was a key moment for us to share back our reactions from the intervention and also help Mamas que Leen reach a bigger audience. We shared photos with Mamas que leen so they could also share on their own social media channels. The main takeaway of the event for me was that this intervention was the only one that addressed women in vulnerable situations and from non European countries. The assistants to the event we talked to were intrigued by the collage results and also started a debate about women\u2019s rights in the SWANA region. Representing the voices of all women is important, especially of those that cannot afford the time and space to attend these types of events. We were particularly cautious of not making our voices be more important than those of las \u201cMam\u00e1s que leen\u201d, which is why the collages were at the forefront of the exhibition space.

Paula is an amazing Design Lead with background in political sciences that has worked in initiatives to prevent sexual harassment and to financially empower women through microloans. We will be playing remotely with Chat GPT3 to explore alternative uses of this technology and suggest how this technology can also be better used, considering ethical constraints. I had a co-creating design session with Paula on February 3 rd . We are interested in developing some type of product with a gender lens. You can check out this initial presentation with our emerging ideas. We explored using chat GPT3 for rehearsing important conversations. Some initial learnings from our exploration: Chat GPT3 is not good at providing information beyond what is inputted. Does not offer skills for managing conversations Some interesting findings when inputting CVs with job descriptions Can write cover letters Can outline talking points to make a convincing argument Focus on salary negotiations might be a good starting point considering limitations of the tool You can input performance reviews, emails from bosses, chat conversations We will launch a quick survey to gather ideas on what makes a good salary negotiation. For the survey, I designed an airtable form linked to an airtable gallery card view to enable users to submit answers but also to openly visualize other users\u2019 responses. This is a first probe to see if people are willing to share salary increases publicly and openly, and to see if this is a tool they may also use in these types of negotiations. After publicly sharing the link on Linkedin, with personal colleagues and with communities of designers in Latin America, our next iteration will be to recommend Chat GPT3 use cases to have actual conversations around salary increase with their employers. Even though in my conversation with Tomas he mentioned to just deploy fast and maybe move on to a new experiment, I feel there is potential in these types of tools around salary negotiations, transparency and the potential for financial power being transferred back to women. What do next steps for this look like? Measure traction of surveys and analyze patterns in data (what makes a good salary negotiation?) Share GPT3 tools with community You can see the results we got in this table. The release of the survey allowed me to craft these early insights: A lot of women realized they had never negotiated a salary before so they could not answer the survey. Many men and women are scared of answering surveys because they might lose their job if the employer finds out. Salary negotiation is not only taboo but is also penalized. Women that did fill out the form had to design \u201chacks\u201d to get their salary to be fair and readjusted. i.e. talk about type of contract, ask current employees on Linkedin. Companies lie during the process and don\u2019t disclose salaries. Some opportunity areas: Design for hacks? While tech can help, negotiating salaries has to do with managing culture, making allies and engaging key people in the org to support your raise. I chose to keep this intervention on standby to focus on the other two, but I may resume it in the last trimester.","title":"Exploring GPT3 to combat gender inequality (healing trauma and salary negotiations)"},{"location":"project/04-Interventions%20and%20activities%20-%20Second%20Trimester/#bologna-book-fair","text":"As an early activity to explore my interest in children\u2019s books as a means to actively imagine the future with them, I attended the Bologna Book Fair with Wen as illustrators from March 6 th to 8 th . We also participated by submitting our personal illustrations on the Virtual Illustrators Wall. However, our focus was to be absorbed by the event itself and understand the publishing side of the business and get familiar with editorials all over the world. Some emerging learnings for me were: The emerging genre of silent books (or wordless books) Visual narratives that need no translators as they are designed to be understood without the use of words. Beautiful concept when thinking of imaging futures beyond language. Emotional regulation and soft skills as key themes Children are being actively taught to cope with difficult emotions and are no longer taboo. Alzheimers, depression, grief, war and even rape are some of the subject matters for children\u2019s books. This was surprising to me because when I was younger these are topics that maybe TV shows for teenagers would target but never a cultural product designed for children. Women\u2019s representation - As the event coincided with March 8 th , there was a dedicated section devoted to engaging women in publishers and representing women in different lenses. LGBTQ representation, gender fluidity. These concepts are no longer taboo in certain European countries, though not the case for Asian, Easter and Latin American countries.

Solving gender inequalities is actually one of the most effective ways to help combat global warming, and notions of femininity and how it links to our perception of the Earth also relates to how we as humans are damaging the environment. It is quite difficult to separate these concepts and while I was initially not particularly interested in focusing on environment and ecologies, I have found myself immersed in this subject. In relation to the ways of drifting, I feel this Trimester I have had an expansive and a probing approach. Expansive because I have deliberately linked all my interventions to gender equality and probing because I have also allowed myself to flow and find interconnections with my classmates, even pushing some interventions that are more artistic (like the one I did with Carolina and Mam\u00e1s que Leen). Due to this shift in my thinking, I have outlined an alternative present below. Present continuities Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) don\u2019t have allocated time, space or skills to actively imagine future scenarios that are optimistic and also daring. Crafting futures is typically reserved to spaces dominated by capitalist logics of extraction and exclusively reserved to privileged humans that have the space and time to monetize efforts to predict the future, without taking into consideration planetary wellbeing (ecologies) or even the desire and needs of minorities (or feminist perspectives). Alternative present Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) have the tools, skills and designated spaces to not only imagine but actively co-create futures with an ecofeminist perspective. Building futures is an active ongoing exercise that exists in education spaces, inside homes and in social gatherings through collage creation, story building and participatory games that welcome differences of perception and thought. This helps combat echo chambers and filter bubbles since the futures are created welcoming and exploring the complex nuances of difference of thought.","title":"Exploring alternative presents"},{"location":"term1/01-Bootcamp/","text":"Bootcamp \u00b6 What is my fight? \u00b6 This week has been an incredible starting point to begin to comprehend the way MDEF works, the collaborative networks that exist between IAAC and Elisava with other organizations in Poblenou and Barcelona and the mindsets required to thrive in the program.

This was eye opening for me since my previous definition of prototyping used to be more linked to experimentation at the service of improving goods and services. Now I realize the power a more exploratory and open-ended approach to prototyping can have in the design process and the richness that can emerge out of this mindset. This is some of my previous experience prototyping: The prototype as an experimental concept. \u00b6 Previously, I have done this type of prototyping by executing A/B tests to determine the best variables for the value proposition of a new service that offered couples counseling for men to reduce conflict. We wanted to learn which type of copy in a Facebook ad generated the highest conversion. We quickly learned that men joining the program were motivated to do so to reduce the number of fights and have happier relationships as opposed to directions that were more vague, offering a new journey or a new challenge. It was important to hit the right tone of voice and communicate the most appealing value proposition since we only had two months to recruit 1,500 men for our pilot service of the program. Without quick prototyping it would\u2019ve been impossible to achieve this ambitious objective. In 2017 me and my team had to define the value proposition and brand for a new education start-up focused on teaching digital skills to Latin American professionals. We quickly designed 3 different websites with opposing look and feels and showed the prototypes to real users. We gathered their reactions and went with the most liked visual direction that was more modern yet bold. The prototype allowed us to have a stronger point of view as to which was the communication path we had to follow. This was a starting point to creating the brand of Colectivo23 , an edtech startup for Latin American professionals that now has over 5,000 alumni. The prototype as a means of inquiry. \u00b6 In 2015 I worked with a group of space and interaction designers from La Victoria Lab and IDEO. We had to test on a 1:1 scale the service design of a new network of low cost high quality healthcare clinics in Peru. We used foam and cheap materials to simulate the different areas. We tested with real users (pregnant women) and helped them navigate the space while gathering their reactions. This prototype allowed us to test with real dimensions while still being low fidelity, cheap and quick to produce. We allowed users to walk freely around the space, move things around and quickly iterated our setup until we were more confident with our design direction.

We wanted to learn which type of copy in a Facebook ad generated the highest conversion. We quickly learned that men joining the program were motivated to do so to reduce the number of fights and have happier relationships as opposed to directions that were more vague, offering a new journey or a new challenge. It was important to hit the right tone of voice and communicate the most appealing value proposition since we only had two months to recruit 1,500 men for our pilot service of the program. Without quick prototyping it would\u2019ve been impossible to achieve this ambitious objective. In 2017 me and my team had to define the value proposition and brand for a new education start-up focused on teaching digital skills to Latin American professionals. We quickly designed 3 different websites with opposing look and feels and showed the prototypes to real users. We gathered their reactions and went with the most liked visual direction that was more modern yet bold. The prototype allowed us to have a stronger point of view as to which was the communication path we had to follow. This was a starting point to creating the brand of Colectivo23 , an edtech startup for Latin American professionals that now has over 5,000 alumni.","title":"The prototype as an experimental concept."},{"location":"term1/03-Roles%20of%20prototyping/#the-prototype-as-a-means-of-inquiry","text":"In 2015 I worked with a group of space and interaction designers from La Victoria Lab and IDEO.

We tested with real users (pregnant women) and helped them navigate the space while gathering their reactions.

It was really mind blowing for me to learn about biology intersecting with design and biomaterial creation. Learning about biohackers and their relation with the cyber punk movement was incredibly inspiring as making biology accessible and DIY is one of the first steps towards empowerment and decentralizing knowledge across fields. With a personal background in social sciences and communications, I had never made my own bioplastics before and while doing the experiment with my group it was very humbling to initially get the measurements wrong but then fix the situation collectively. We were awed by what you can make in your own kitchen and how you can start experimenting with new bioplastics at home with materials you can purchase locally and hassle-free. After these two weeks I am inspired by the potential of combining the discipline of design with biology, especially as it can correlate with public policy, new material creation and circular economy and more sustainable ways of inhabiting planet Earth. As designers, we learn how to experiment in a maybe less organized and systematic way than in the fields of scientific research. One takeaway I get is learning to journal and write everything down with as much precision and rigurosity as possible. This is especially useful when analyzing results and coming up with conclusions. Peer reviews and collaboration in scientific papers also make me wonder how that can be translated to the design space with the same rigurosity and spirit of systematic new knowledge creation.

Analyzing a news article and contrasting with the original cited scientific paper \u00b6 Scientific papers and journals are a great source to get closer to scientific evidence, this interests me especially since lately I had previously been working with evidence-based means of generating impact in social science. I was curious to learn more about how scientific papers in the field of biology can be used for this purpose as well. The article I have chosen is from the science section of The Guardian, titled \u201cCommuni-cat-ive: cats attentive to owner\u2019s voice, research finds\u201d. I chose the subject matter because I was curious how this new piece of information could impact and inform the future of human-animal interactions. It argues that cats are able to tune into their human owner\u2019s tone of voice to determine when they are being spoken to. The article does a good job in referring directly to the original research paper, a study done by university students at Paris Nanterre University. The research published in Animal Cognition adds to mounting evidence that one-to-one relationships are important for cats and humans to form strong bonds. Previous research in the field specifically analyzes dogs (linked below) and this is one of the first research focused entirely on cats. This conclusion is interesting since bonds between humans and animals can be found regardless of species. An important following question could be: Are domestic animals more prone to human-animal bonds because of the way they have been conditioned to evolve? The scientific paper was tested with a small cohort of 16 domestic cats and explores human-animal relationship in comparison and contrast to baby-adult relationships. According to the news article, \u201cthey found that the cats were largely unresponsive to hearing a stranger\u2019s voice calling their name, but when their owner did it, 10 of the 16 cats displayed a constellation of behaviours suggesting increased attentiveness.\u201d Because of the framing, rather than a scientific truth the article seems to refer to a rather preliminary and exploratory research that provokes interesting questions. Regarding the original scientific paper, I found that the conclusions established on the news article are similar. However, some observations I could make is that I think the sample the university students worked with is very small. They only studied 16 cats and the news article refers to the results as if they were long-established scientific truths. I would be curious to learn the results of this same research taken one step further, maybe outside academia or at a level beyond university research. A good practice the journalist has done is link to the original scientific paper within the news article. I had no trouble reading the entire scientific paper, including their methodology, observations and conclusions. The exercise has allowed me to understand the importance of going back to the original source and trusting the scientific paper as opposed to the news article\u2019s bold statements.

Whenever I leave my house, I will take it with me inside my purse but allowing for its eyes (2 bottle caps) to look into the outside world. what does it notice? The family totem notices my emotions whenever I miss my family in Peru and can tune into them and distract me by asking me to \u201cfeed it\u201d, \u201cdecorate it\u201d or just stare at it while thinking of my loved ones. what were you thinking? While building it I was thinking of a way to reconnect with my family. Initially I was planning on creating some sort of viewfinder that could allow me to browse through pictures of them, then it evolved into some sort of \u201cdoll\u201d I could care for as a replacement. I now believe its more of a symbolic totem that I should place in a special place to honor their place in my life. why does it matter? The family totem matters because it helped me reflect that rather than \u201creplacing\u201d who you miss it is best to honor the space they occupy while acknowledging the distance. I think the fact that the totem is big in size and not as portable is a good example of this reflection. Another reflection I had while building the totem is that adding eyes or an outfit to it allowed me to create a stronger emotional connection with it. If I focused on perceiving it as \u201ccute\u201d, it helped bring me joy and turn a negative emotion into something more positive or at least nostalgic in a constructive manner. Evaluation After spending a whole day with the family totem, I realized due to its size that it is very difficult to carry. It almost feels like a \u201cweight\u201d one needs to let go of to be able to handle daily tasks. This made me reflect how nostalgia or sadness sometimes needs its own space and time to not interrupt with daily life. It is also highly noticeable for others and seems more like something I would want to keep in a private and intimate space. For the second half of the day, I dedicated a special space for the Totem in my living room. This seemed more suitable as I could devote dedicated minutes to staring at it and forcefully thinking of my family back in Peru. One quick reflection I had was related to private / public spaces and where the companion seems to accomplish its objective more meaningfully. Thinking about materiality, if I were to rebuild or iterate this prototype I would use something more durable and polished. Something I like about the Totem is that it allows you to reminisce in a more free and abstract manner without literally looking at a photograph, which at times can take you to a very specific time and place. First person perspective: Quantifying household chores \u00b6 I wanted to explore a way to quantify household chores using time as a unit of measure while recording myself cleaning my apartment using the slowest mechanism possible (i.e. using a broom as opposed to a vacuum cleaner, hand washing dishes as opposed to using a dishwasher and hand washing my clothes as opposed to using a washing machine). I wanted to explore gender roles, considering that an unequal division of household chores between men and women usually contributes to gender inequality. I was inspired by the 1920s boom in technology when vacuum cleaners and other time-saving electronic devices were invented as a means of empowering women and allowing them to enter the workforce. However, 100 years later women typically spend disproportionately more time on unpaid care work than men even though technology in the cleaning space is still going in the direction of time-saving and automation (such as Roombas). The trend of \u201cCleantoks\u201d on TikTok is making visible the craft of cleaning while mostly women are sharing tips, tricks and hacks to make their homes as clean as possible. I had doubts as to what I could learn from this experiment since these are tasks I mostly do spread out during an entire week and are not completely new to me. I think the process made me reflect on my cleaning process and how caring for your house can also be a political act. There is also value in quantifying the time and effort it requires to perform a task when looking at the potential of dividing chores equally among couples, roommates or families. Additionally, the act of recording yourself doing this task also makes it considerably more visible. Some questions that emerged from this experiment: What does it mean to clean without technology today? How can cleaning without technology evidence the value and time involved in this type of unpaid labor? How can quantifying the time invested in cleaning help with distribution of household chores?

Our team \u201cEagle eyes\u201d had to disassemble a video conference camera that tracks voice to follow participants in a physical space connected to a Zoom call. The device in itself is considerably a few years old. We forgot to test if the device itself worked because of the excitement of beginning to unscrew its components and seeing what was inside this specific \u201cBlack box\u201d. We were very tempted to use a hammer and start breaking things apart but enjoyed the challenge of only using screwdrivers and disassembling it with patience and respecting the final form of each of its parts. One of the highlights of the first week was learning that the individual components sold separately were much more expensive than buying the old video camera on eBay today. The camera had devalued itself considerably in only 5 years because of the low quality of the video camera. However it could be fixed to work perfectly and many of its parts were designed to be thrown out even if it could be designed as a device where the camera is replaced every couple of years to avoid waste creation and having to buy a completely new product. Another observation that stood out for me was that there were red Sharpie marks for labeling individual components inside the device. This gave us a clue that some part of the building of the device was fully manual and relied on man-made effort. The marks seemed to be hastily written down and I was surprised to learn that some part of its industrial assembly line involved humans having to manually label internal components inside the machine. Link to original forensic report https://hackmd.io/FGIM55OESi-aVK3K8WSJNw?view Week 2 \u00b6 During the second week we had to begin by tinkering with the components found inside the Eagle eyes. Our group had fun proposing ideas and letting our judgment go during this stage of the creative process. We brainstormed and ideated ideas as wild as a robotic frog, a cyclops and a zombie. One of the team\u2019s successes was in quickly aligning on a concept and building on top of it during the week. We had to let go of the urge to design in a linear way and try to think of ways to make the product useful. Instead, we had playful fun while making our robot look as aesthetic as possible and making our pendulum swing in a way that would make the movement more exaggerated to simulate a \u201creal hypnosis session.\u201d blockquote Our team was lucky in that it had 3 team members that had previous experience coding, using Arduino and setting up electronics. This meant that we could specialize in specific tasks to manage and distribute the use of time. While this also meant that there was little time for failure in the setting up of the electronics, I learned by observing attentively how my teammates used Arduino and played with the code to ensure the speed, pauses and movement were the correct ones for each of the artifacts we wanted to implement. One of the greatest challenges was in setting up the dependencies within our system. We wanted the pendulum and the robot to start moving at the same time as sound was detected in our sensing boards and this proved to be a challenge in the coding part. Finally, I had a lot of fun stepping out of my comfort zone by tinkering with electronic materials, looking at which motors and sensors could be reused for other purposes and contributing by actively documenting the final presentation and leading the video creation with the help of my team\u2019s creativity in script writing and voice over recording. Overall, I have learned to take ownership of technology I would usually consider \u201cuseless\u201d if not working properly for its original purpose. Hacking technology and tinkering with elements is an interesting way to play with the design process and be swept by what is right in front of you. I will try to apply tinkering to my designer toolkit. Another reflection I will carry with me after these two weeks is to ask more questions regarding hardware and technology, looking at the incentives behind design decisions related to fabrication, use of materials, longevity of the device itself. Some questions that emerged from disassembling the Eagle Eyes and transforming it into a \u201calmost useless machine\u201d: Why are we rewarded for purchasing a completely new product?

Our team \u201cEagle eyes\u201d had to disassemble a video conference camera that tracks voice to follow participants in a physical space connected to a Zoom call. The device in itself is considerably a few years old. We forgot to test if the device itself worked because of the excitement of beginning to unscrew its components and seeing what was inside this specific \u201cBlack box\u201d. We were very tempted to use a hammer and start breaking things apart but enjoyed the challenge of only using screwdrivers and disassembling it with patience and respecting the final form of each of its parts. One of the highlights of the first week was learning that the individual components sold separately were much more expensive than buying the old video camera on eBay today. The camera had devalued itself considerably in only 5 years because of the low quality of the video camera. However it could be fixed to work perfectly and many of its parts were designed to be thrown out even if it could be designed as a device where the camera is replaced every couple of years to avoid waste creation and having to buy a completely new product. Another observation that stood out for me was that there were red Sharpie marks for labeling individual components inside the device. This gave us a clue that some part of the building of the device was fully manual and relied on man-made effort. The marks seemed to be hastily written down and I was surprised to learn that some part of its industrial assembly line involved humans having to manually label internal components inside the machine.

One of the highlights for me was getting to know the work of Donella H. Meadows and becoming familiar with visual ways to map systems, including the actors involved but also the root causes and other non-human elements that will inevitably shape the way a system functions. We were provided with hands-on tools to set the stage when dealing with different stakeholders in the same room, each with their own hopes, fears and interests in relation to specific topics that are addressed. Another takeaway for me was that system maps do not attempt to be 100% comprehensive but rather a visual way to communicate complexity. This is why it is not necessary for them to be exhaustive. Another highlight for me was the introduction to the \u201cGroup work card decks\u201d. I chose the \u201cSilence\u201d card when instructed to pick one that resonated most with ourselves at the moment. It reminded me of an advice I was once given by a Project Lead when doing design research. She told me that when interviewing users one should not rush to fulfill the interview guide as quickly as possible but to allow for silence since this is usually when users would give the most interesting reflective and even unexpected answers. I now want to feel comfortable with silence as a design tool and will think of ways to incorporate it in my next interventions as an ally. Visually mapping the complexity of my intervention \u00b6 As an exercise for the class we attempted to map out the conflict related to our collective intervention and to our design space. I focused on school children (since this is the community I will first engage with) in relation to gender stereotypes, expectations and the possibility of domestic violence while also including other factors in the mix. The end result is depicted below. This was my first draft. Although it appears very incomplete I felt it was extremely useful in identifying non-human influences that may be found in the ecosystem and also the ways elements interrelate between each other as I plan to initially engage with children but may later reach out to other types of communities. Another experiment I tried out this week was to visually map the Gender ecosystem in Barcelona I was capturing for my personal project. I used Kumu and this is what the end result looked like. I particularly like how Kumu shows the interconnections between actors and how the movement makes it look like a living organism.** Double clicking on my intervention and potential nuances \u00b6 Deep diving on the collective intervention and how it relates to the tools learned in community engagement with Holon and Milena, I have outlined the following diagram below. I plan on working with Ariel who is interested in climate change perception and we plan on integrating both a gender and a climate change perspective to our project. Creative community: School children in Poblenou and Badalona. Context: Gender stereotypes and ways to solve conflict are embedded and ingrained starting from childhood in family homes, schools, media and public places. We are planning on engaging with 6-9 year old school children in high complexity and low complexity schools to understand their perceptions in regards to gender roles and climate change. Current situation: Schools are very eager to engage with students and designers that are willing to use new creative methods for class. This is a great opportunity for us to create a close collaboration with them. On the other hand, we are planning on co-creating future visions with the children themselves since they are the ones that will benefit from better and improved futures in regards to gender inclusiveness and gender equality. Engagement and limits: For engaging with children, we plan on working closely with the teachers that already have the parents\u2019 trust. We also plan to follow strict guidelines to protect the identity of the children in the shareback of the project such as blurring their faces and not mentioning their names or last names. We will also be very mindful of our use of cameras and focus on recording the outputs of the workshop rather than the children themselves. Theory of change: Our theory of change is understanding the voice of children and their perceptions as active designers and co-creators. We will channel horizontality with them and give them the creative tools to design their own future visions. We believe that children are the protagonists of any future engagement and their point of view should be considered from the starting point of any intervention we plan on designing in the future. I also believe that addressing emotional regulation with children and demystifying stereotypes can also be a way to challenge perceptions that violence is an acceptable tool for solving conflict. Design challenges: Some challenges that may emerge are linking the interventions with the content they are taught as part of their academic curriculum. If it is too detached from their day-to-day content we may lose engagement or retention since we can only intervene for a limited amount of time. Another challenge that may engage is related to the use of language in particular when talking about gender. It will be interesting to design ways to address these issues without directly talking about gender, i.e. emotional regulation, inclusion. It will be a challenge to also work with children in different age ranges and socioeconomic status because of varying levels of comprehension and literacy. Design opportunities: There is a great opportunity in visualizing the results of the creative intervention with children and using a maker or creative centered approach. It will be also super rich to learn from the narratives and stories the children themselves propose. There is also an opportunity in designing for the teacher and having the teacher be a facilitator of the activity rather than a passive actor. Because of the creative nature of the intervention, there is an opportunity area to make a fanzine or a creative publication gathering the results of all of the children and seeing what comes out of this collective venture.","title":"Community engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20engagement/#community-engagement","text":"","title":"Community Engagement"},{"location":"term1/07-Community%20engagement/#mapping-complex-systems","text":"This week we focused on understanding and mapping all the agents involved in complex systems to then ideate ways to intervene at a community level and co-design with all voices in one room.

We began by double clicking on the subject of what is intelligence, looking at definitions as old as Ancient Greece and Plato and then linking those concepts back to the latest advancements in these types of technologies. Since AI is built by man-made inputs such as datasets and the humans behind them are constantly making key decisions on what is prioritized, it is thus an imperfect product and we should not expect a \u201crobotic\u201d perfection from it. We should actually look for ways to help the AI achieve its end goal looking at mitigating risks for both humans and the environment. The myth that AI is a rational agent is founded upon the myth that robots and humans are at opposing ends of a spectrum. We don\u2019t talk about humans as rational agents and therefore we should not expect the same from our man-made technology. Adding to this, I also learned that AI is built with intrinsic human biases that we should be on the active lookout for. We were recommended the book \u201cData feminism\u201d (i) to reflect more on how biases can be found in both the datasets and inputs as well as the final AI solutions. Something I found interesting that already existed were datasets that included hate speech or microsexist aggressions in the workplace as a means to actively combat biases. (ii) This was of particular interest to me because it showed also how AI can be proactive in identifying hate speech and not just perpetuating it. Group Project - The Active Listener \u00b6 One of the highlights for me was working as a group on designing an AI starting from the concept all the way to the inputs and datasets needed for its creation. Conceptually, it was interesting the questions the exercise itself raised. I particularly remember the example of a team tasked with designing a \u201cpet companion\u201d and the questions that this scenario could raise. For example: How do you design the personality for a dog? What is the personality of a dog and what adjectives should we use? What are the visual signs of a dog\u2019s personality? The categories of types of AI also helped organize my thoughts around my understanding of this type of technology, such as planners, recommenders or personal assistants like Alexa. My team worked on an Active Listener , an AI solution that allowed humans to feel heard by the device and offered empathy in response. It was interesting to me how it was more important to \u201csimulate care and aid\u201d rather than the machine actually comprehending and empathizing with the human using it. We want to feel heard just as much as we want to be heard. Another interesting takeaway was the use of the text processor GPT3 that is built on neural networks. Me and Wen were interested in exploring uses of GPT3 as a means for healing in terms of mental health and also violent relationships, and this coincided with the construction of our Active Listener. Running fast experiments on Open AI\u2019s playground, we learned that the tool is surprisingly good at emulating healthy communication, acting empathetic and also being in tune with the user\u2019s emotions. It was fun and also enlightening to play with the technology and datasets while outlining our plan for the Active Listener. The use of Google Colaboratory, shown to us by Taller Estampa, was also a surprising find for me. The logic of working in cells and running the code on an online server showed me how powerful and also increasingly accessible AI is becoming. Finally, I believe this week has been very enlightening for me. Me and Wen will plan on running product demos with real users to test our AI version of a bot that can connect people with their younger selves and people they no longer have access to. Personally, I also want to deep dive on Caroline Sinders\u2019 work on feminist data sets and see if AI can be actively built to combat sexist biases.

I have previously worked using user-centricity as the norm and the new \u201creligion\u201d in corporate environments. But user-centricity is highly flawed when you only design for one individual, the one with purchasing power and disregard how that will affect the rest of the ecosystem involved.

Rethinking tech companies as data extraction centers and beginning to monitor how my relationship with them influences my day-to-day life. Changing my cell phone screen to black and white is a first step in this direction. This was also a topic that caught my attention due to the great amount of time we devote to using social media in exchange for our data and how technology is evolving at the service of distracting us. Looking at climate change as a symptom and redesign processes looking at the root causes. Thirdly, one important reflection that arose from this week is how can we begin to dig deeper into the root causes of societal problems and be critical of how they relate to consumerism, capitalism and our nocive ways of relating with our planet. Assignments \u00b6 A Day in My Post Technological Life For this exercise I learned that nature (even if I can\u2019t tell in my everyday life) plays an important role in my perception of a desirable future. I aspire for more peace, mental clarity and fulfillment rather than overstimulation through consumption and digital screens. Group Assignment - Time capsule For the group assignment we spent a whole day walking from Cosmocaixa Museum back to IAAC and taking photographs of things in the city that caught our attention. It was an interesting way to engage with Barcelona and we even walked past Marc\u2019s school. While I feel we interpreted the assignment too photographically, using the images we took as an only prompt was an interesting forcing function to imagine as a group what the future would look like. This was my first collective exercise in future imagining. Letter from your future self Transcript: Dear younger self, Do not rush to find answers to the questions of what you want to do with this next chapter of your life. \u201cLive the questions now\u201d, like Rilke said, for life experiences are waiting to happen in the future but focus on the ones happening today, in your present. They have been designed for this unique moment in your journey and will most likely not repeat themselves in this particular moment in linear time. What you are learning today about designing a better future is exactly what you needed to hear to pursue those passion projects that will evolve to become larger than yourself. But first be patient and close your eyes. The present is always the most beautiful moment in linear time. Also remember there are no straight lines in nature and so there are no straight paths in liFe. You will fail and you will fall, and you will rise back up again but do not fear those moments of failure because they will lead you where you need to be. But where can you find those answers to the questions you are looking for now? Go to nature, design with nature and think of the design principles of nature and ways you can bring that back to the challenges of the future. You are doing ok. I love you, always, in linear and non-linear time. - Your \u201cyou of the future\u201d","title":"Designing for the next billion seconds"},{"location":"term2/01-Designing%20for%20the%20next%20billion%20seconds/#designing-for-the-next-billion-seconds","text":"This week was a journey in questioning my notions of linear time, my relationship with the environment and a way to nurture my curiosity in new books.

This was also a topic that caught my attention due to the great amount of time we devote to using social media in exchange for our data and how technology is evolving at the service of distracting us. Looking at climate change as a symptom and redesign processes looking at the root causes. Thirdly, one important reflection that arose from this week is how can we begin to dig deeper into the root causes of societal problems and be critical of how they relate to consumerism, capitalism and our nocive ways of relating with our planet.","title":"Below are the three takeaways I mapped out during class:"},{"location":"term2/01-Designing%20for%20the%20next%20billion%20seconds/#assignments","text":"A Day in My Post Technological Life For this exercise I learned that nature (even if I can\u2019t tell in my everyday life) plays an important role in my perception of a desirable future. I aspire for more peace, mental clarity and fulfillment rather than overstimulation through consumption and digital screens. Group Assignment - Time capsule For the group assignment we spent a whole day walking from Cosmocaixa Museum back to IAAC and taking photographs of things in the city that caught our attention. It was an interesting way to engage with Barcelona and we even walked past Marc\u2019s school. While I feel we interpreted the assignment too photographically, using the images we took as an only prompt was an interesting forcing function to imagine as a group what the future would look like. This was my first collective exercise in future imagining. Letter from your future self Transcript: Dear younger self, Do not rush to find answers to the questions of what you want to do with this next chapter of your life. \u201cLive the questions now\u201d, like Rilke said, for life experiences are waiting to happen in the future but focus on the ones happening today, in your present. They have been designed for this unique moment in your journey and will most likely not repeat themselves in this particular moment in linear time. What you are learning today about designing a better future is exactly what you needed to hear to pursue those passion projects that will evolve to become larger than yourself. But first be patient and close your eyes. The present is always the most beautiful moment in linear time. Also remember there are no straight lines in nature and so there are no straight paths in liFe. You will fail and you will fall, and you will rise back up again but do not fear those moments of failure because they will lead you where you need to be. But where can you find those answers to the questions you are looking for now? Go to nature, design with nature and think of the design principles of nature and ways you can bring that back to the challenges of the future. You are doing ok. I love you, always, in linear and non-linear time. - Your \u201cyou of the future\u201d","title":"Assignments"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/","text":"Design studio - Second Trimester \u00b6 Assignment: Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back. Analyze your so-called \u201cfailures\u201d as opportunities for redefining your frames of reference and repositioning yourself and your project accordingly. How has my project evolved? \u00b6 During the first trimester, I set out to map the gender / innovation / tech ecosystem in Barcelona, gather a community interested in deep diving on these subjects and conducting short and quick experiments both individually and collectively to identify connections both from a subject matter perspective to connecting with other peers in MDEF. After the first trimester I had 3 theories of change I wanted to deep dive further in: What if we imagined an automated chatbot that heals violent relationships and trauma? I learned that healing using GPT3 can sit within ethical borders and it is best to use this technology for actual conversations that will indeed happen in the future. ie. Helping someone practice for a break-up conversation, using chat as a means to teach people about non-violent communication. What if we actively fought gender bias and harassment through machine generated imagery and words? For this one, I wrote a medium article and shared it on my newsletter. While I feel it is a great opportunity area, I feel generating feminist data sets will be a bit too time-consuming considering the time frames of the Master so will put this one on hold. What if we co-created future visions on gender equality with children? I will run a workshop with 75 9-year old children in a school in Badalona with Ariel and Wen. The objective is to use these imagined futures as a means to work towards those goals for the rest of my interventions. Arising opportunity areas: \u00b6 These are 2 areas I will deep dive in this second trimester. What if we co-created future visions on ecofeminism with migrant women? This can shift power balance, allow them to discover their voices and be an introduction towards developing a futures literacy muscle. What if we taught non-violent communication through micro digital stories for children? New project goals \u00b6 While I feel my areas of interest and weak signals have not changed, process-wise I am learning to flow more freely and let myself be swept away by potential collaborations that may emerge even if they don\u2019t fit precisely into my original ideas. I also plan on using interventions as a way to gain insights rather than as a means to designing a final product or service. The interventions for the following month are as follows: Deep dive on collage-creation workshop with Ariel and Wen My intention in this intervention is to use the end results imagined by children as starting points for my experiments for a final project. What futures do children imagine in relation to gender equality and ecofeminism? Intervention with Carolina on futures literacy with migrant women. We intend to give voice to women in vulnerable situations through a collage exercise to capture ancestral knowledge and think of ways of documenting beyond texts and verbal language. Personal project - Online open-source glossary on gender-related terminology and/or micro digital storybooks to teach children Non-Violent Communication Personal project - AI chatbot to help men and women navigate difficult conversations Iteration of Innerbot (from first trimester) and content curated by a Non Violent Communication expert. Some scripts to explore for chatbot: Rehearsing a couples\u2019 negotiation Talking about couple finances Women asking for a raise Simulating a break up Helping fathers have healthy communication with their children For pushing this project forward my next steps will be contacting Taller Estampa for technical help and playing with chat GPT3 to emulate the scenarios. After having an initial prototype, I will seek the aid of a Nonviolent Communication expert and a GBV expert. Intervention 1 Second Trimester- Imagining futures with children \u00b6 Workshop plan \u00b6 We will do a school intervention with 75 9-year old children in Sant Andreu school in Badalona. The activity is divided into 3 classes of approx. 20 children (75 children in total). For us to implement this workshop we had to leverage the trust Xavi and Fab Lab team had already created with schools in Badalona and had to email the Principal and key coordinators for over 2 months. It is hard to schedule activities with children since they need to be integrated into key dates of the academic calendars. Co-creation process \u00b6 For the co-creation process, we first built on the findings from the public parks interventions and design dialogues from Trimester I. Mariana gave us some insights and guidelines to approach the intervention in this second round. We visited the school on Wednesday to co-create with the tutor and ask her relevant content questions, how the exercise fits with the regular curricula and what we can change to create more engagement with the children. We decided to ask children more specific questions - i.e. how do you imagine zoos of the future? or parks of the future? or schools of the future? or sports of the future? as opposed to a general \u201cHow do you imagine the future?\u201d question. This specificity will help them be much more concrete with their answers which is rich input for us as designers. As mentioned above, trust building with schools was done through Xavi\u2019s Fab Lab network and took a couple of months to actually schedule the activity. Since schools have to provide a uniform experience for all children in one grade, we needed to replicate the activity with all 75 students and had to run a pretty big pilot. We decided to start off with only one class and then iterate the activity for the remaining 2 classes. 1 st intervention with 24 children \u00b6 Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 20 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 24 children The workshop lasted 45 minutes. The teachers were very open to what we proposed and actually felt they couldn\u2019t interrupt our session. Children were very happy and motivated by our presence. We documented photos, videos and voice recordings but were careful to take pictures of their individual faces because of child protection laws. One thing we noticed we could improve was help teachers feel more involved with the activity. We felt that teachers felt they could take a break and rest from their busy schedules but were also very interested and curious of the content. Incorporating teachers more actively can be something we can improve later on. In preparation for the activity, we designed a short presentation that would serve as an introduction (who we are, our backgrounds, where we come from and introduction to climate change and gender equality). You can check the attached presentation here with our group findings You can hear some of their stories from this session here. Mapped improvements for next iterations: \u00b6 Show collage cutouts later since children are easily distracted. Once they saw the collage cut outs they stopped thinking of the futures and focused more on the images themselves. Spend a bit more time on introduction, asking them questions about the topic area and having a horizontal conversation. They are very young so they are more interested in animals than in humans. They do not comprehend very much gender inequality. It is a very complex subject for them so it would be best to talk about inclusion in general. Teachers are willing to do more activities with them and use innovative tools in their classes. This can also be an opportunity to onboard teachers on new tools and exercises. Teachers want to participate too! and design their futures. First teacher imagined a school with modular furniture that quickly transformed into different settings for diverse learning styles. Children are happy to help us imagine futures and enthusiastic about welcoming new people into their classrooms. Childrens\u2019 imagined futures grouped thematically: \u00b6 Parks: New animal species. Animals, fruits and no cars so animals are not scared, vet in parks. Pokemons are part of parks. Schools: Poor children are fed in schools, bread to feed everyone in schools. Zoos: Punishing people that kill animals by making them go to jail, animal protection. No zoos, animals free to roam around. People in charge of animal rescue. Animals are trained to become stronger so we can live with wild animals and feed them, live with them without killing others. Where you can be friends with animals and they are not hunted. Sports: Each person chooses their uniform, their way to express themselves. In one same area all sports can be held in the same area, it can be transformed for different sports. Emerging insights from this first intervention: \u00b6 Better futures for children are more inclusive futures and non-humans are very included. Mindful of eating, nourishment, especially for poor children. Children imagine better futures in regards to inclusion more than inequality, ie. letting all animals be in a zoo, letting everyone participate in sports, no uniforms, letting everyone express themselves freely. Sidenote: Children associate \u201cpoor\u201d people with racial diversity. Children have a hard time also reflecting on their own school experience and prefer to design for children from lower income families. My personal takeaways on how this intervention relates to emerging visions on gender equality: \u00b6 Children have a hard time imagining gender equality since they are unaware of how society impacts human beings differently according to gender. However children can imagine and imagine a world with more inclusion. This looks like olympics and soccer matches for all ages and all genders, where uniform is a personal choice of expression. Some visions children imagined: \u00b6 Household tasks are distributed equally Interspecies schooling Housing for everyone Places of repair and healing in public spaces This allows us to build a future where preservation and care are pillars in equality and inclusion. Some emerging results from our first iteration in Badalona below. Video with stories imagined by childrens PDF we shared with teachers to schedule the activity. Learnings from doing a first prototype in parks. 2 nd intervention with 50 children \u00b6 Location: Collegio Sant Andreu, Badalona Date: January 27 th , 2023 Grade: Second grade, primary schools Age: 8-9 years old Class size: 50 children (2 classes) The workshop will be almost identical with the previous one with some changes. The children will imagine future scenarios on topics related to climate change and gender equity. They will be making a collage of the future scenario in different settings, for example: future for the park, for the school, sports, etc. based on the theme we selected. For this second iteration of intervention with children, we decided to not show the collage cut outs from the start and to let the children spend more time ideating and focusing on crafting more compelling stories. We allowed them to use color pencils and crayons and not to focus on using cut outs from magazines. This second iteration gave us the following results: \u00b6 After we introduced the collage cut outs, no children used the cut outs anymore. We realized they were more distracting than adding to the experience. What you show at first is crucial for children since it is what they will focus their attention on. Children spent more time collaborating and listening to their peers when they didn\u2019t have distracting elements. The end stories were more reflexive and of higher quality this time around. With the collage in the first iteration, they struggled incorporating all the elements and with no collages being shown, they could focus on their stories and adding details to the stories. Question for future iterations: If we choose not to use collage anymore, what would be the minimum viable prompts we would need to give children for better stories and more engagement? Is the template with the backdrop enough or is there any other element we can incorporate that adds to the experience? Some insights from the second iteration: \u00b6 Content-wise, children are overall optimistic and positive about the future. Some emerging themes from this session: Redistribution of wealth (ie. feeding the poor, free housing for the poor) Inclusion (ie. Sports for all ages and all genders) Freedom (ie. Abolishing zoos) Diversity (ie. New species, interspecies schools) Some emerging results from the second iteration in Badalona in the following link. We received the feedback from faculty to make the workshop more participatory in the sense that children are given increased agency, new facilitation roles and we let go of control to see where the activity takes us and how this can influence their imagined futures. We will also talk to a school psychologist for a future iteration. Ask ourselves, how can this feel co-created rather than imposed? Perception Board (developed during First Fab Lab Challenge) \u00b6 This week I worked with Ariel and Wen to develop a physical product that would allow us to engage with children\u2019s perceptions in relation to 3 different fields: climate change, gender equality and mental health. We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incorporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them.

We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive. Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers. These types of tools can be easily scaled to schools and taught to teachers to implement in classrooms. We hope this can be a low-tech analog way of fighting back filter bubbles in digital social media, allowing and welcoming difference of thought. Incorporating a Speaker Mic to the Perception Board \u00b6 This week I worked with Wen and Ariel on designing a complementary product that would amplify the experience of using our Perception Board. While we haven\u2019t had the time and space to test with school students, we still wanted to iterate on the experience to test with both teachers and students during the Third Trimester. For this challenge, we had to incorporate 3D printing, CNC and sensors. This is why we designed a Speaker Mic that would have the objective of helping define who speaks during a classroom session and can design a small ritual around that moment. Some learnings during this challenge listed below: Fabrication processes take a lot of time and efficient time planning is mandatory. During challenges and when working with time constraints, it is best to align fast and then iterate and add more complex systems to the design. Only the 3D printing took over 18 hours. While most processes are digitally fabricated, manual work is very important for incorporating systems and to make sure final adjustments are done correctly. We had to sand manually, put nails on the 3D printed microphone and make a cardboard box by hand to make sure everything worked correctly at the end. Testing with users the final system is equally as important . While these production weeks focused on fabrication help us design the system, it is also important to go back to our communities and test the product and system with them. We are planning on going back to classrooms to test both the perception board and our speaker mics. Incorporate electronics meaningfully. While we can be very drawn to using electronics playfully and introducing a lot of sensors, we chose to make the interaction as simple as possible. This is because using the board in itself is quite complex for children and electronics should help them understand what action is required from them. Building fast allows you to gain a full picture of the system We were happy to see how our Board was nicely integrated at the end with all the elements. This weeks allow us to move forward and not think too much on the design. This I feel was good because it helped us think of the system as a whole and integrating it with the user experience as fast as possible. One of the feedback we received from Santi was that our classmates gathered around when we showed our artifact which we can take as a positive signal that high school students might be equally as engaged. Project repo Design Dialogues Term 2 \u00b6 I used the Design Dialogues space during March 22 nd as a way to gather feedback primarily on the Perception Board and the Speaker Mic. Overall we were prompted to go test with students because while we may be receiving helpful suggestions, we will never know how they react to the product until we test it out on a classroom. Some of the feedback we received listed below: Circularity and sustainability are topics teachers want and need to address in today\u2019s classroom Try product with smaller groups (max. 10 students) The future is fluid so make sure prompts are flexible and do not reflect a particular political point of view Maybe think of narratives rather than solutions Pointers may be personalized by the children themselves before using them How do we incorporate principles of Non Violent Communication into the process of using the tools we designed? i.e. Respect everyone\u2019s turn Explore \u201curgent\u201d and \u201crelevant\u201d as dimensions for the board Change the design of the board to make it more transport-friendly (i.e. foldable Monopoly board) Intervention 2 Second Trimester - Exploring futures literacy with Mam\u00e1s que leen \u00b6 Workshop plan \u00b6 We started with the initial idea of using collage as a means to empower migrant women and explore futures literacy as a skillset that can be actively developed. After feedback from Tom\u00e1s we decided our engagement strategy would first be have casual conversations with potential communities and organizations and then see which ones are relevant to work with and to generate trust for greater horizontality in the intervention. We decided to reach out to 3 communities: Open Cultural Center Mam\u00e1s que leen Periferias cimarronas After that process we picked the community that was most enthusiastic about collaborating with us: Mam\u00e1s que leen. This document reflects our initial point of view on what the workshop would look like. Trust building - Attending classes before implementing the workshop \u00b6 Me and Carolina went to Mamas que leen on January 24 th to meet Karin the founder, get to know the classes and the location. We left feeling super inspired and they offered 2 1-hour sessions for us to conduct the ecofeminism collage intervention. Some highlights and first impressions from this first visit: The female environment of women teaching women and supporting each other. The huge stigma migration is in Europe and how aggressive it is and how it impacts these women. Their relation to nature before and after migration. The financial struggles of the organization as they seek support from ayuntamiento but receive little funding because Spanish is the language being taught (not Catalan). Latin American women offering themselves as volunteers (from Chile, Peru, Mexico). Potential of future literacy and collage being a third / fourth / fifth language in the room. We are happy that Tom\u00e1s advised us to first blend in and get to know the group. We plan on attending a couple of lessons before implementing the workshop. Frugality. Their lack of knowledge on geography is an opportunity for us to also print maps of their countries (Bangladesh, Morocco and Pakistan). Karin, the founder, suggested we incorporate a vision board so they can reflect about their dreams, goals and hopes. First class we attended at Mamas que Leen - 3 rd February \u00b6 Diary entry: \u201cI went to Mamas que Leen with Carolina. We arrived a bit late and there were only 3 students, Karin and 1 volunteer in the class. They mentioned that there were many students missing because their children had fallen sick with the flu. They were reading a short story as a group with Karin and then Karin gave us a fun game with rolling dice to co-create stories as a group. It felt nice just to spend time with them, getting to know them and them familiarizing with us. We still need to think about the workshop itself, but I am learning that building confidence is just as important for these types of interventions.\u201d Second class we attended at Mamas que Leen - 7 th February \u00b6 Diary entry: \u201cWe arrived on time this time and introduced ourselves to the whole group. They were reading a short story collectively and I was surprised by the trust and humor of the environment. Karin is very good at asking questions and getting the women interested in the texts they are reading.\u201d Applying to Fem Fabrik \u00b6 We co-created a workshop with Carolina and are applying to Fem Fabrik in La Clandestina to see if we can showcase the end result of our workshop with Mamas que leen in a full-day event held for women artists on Saturday 11 th of March. Our shift in the workshop design is to use inputs from female poets that also allude to nature and use that as a starting point to discuss ecofeminism. We chose this because we feel this is a less academic point of view and we can use the poems as an input to highlight keywords and co-create a collective map for the second session. We were selected to Fem Fabrik but were asked to clarify a bit more our intentions. We will be given a 1x1 exhibit space and we are thinking of adapting the format of the fanzine to fit the vertical space we have been assigned. We also need to verify with Karin, founder of Mam\u00e1s que leen, if our participation is ok by her. Workshop prep \u00b6 We made collaborative Google Slides files to crowdsource images for the collage then prepared the file for printing at Elisava. We used bond paper and tried to align aesthetically all the images while allowing for randomness in the content area to emerge. We also curated 5 different poems from female authors that would be talking points to start discussing ecofeminism. We sent our workshop structure to Karin via email to gather her reactions. You can read the workshop structure here. This document reflects our workshop structure. Workshop - 2 sessions \u00b6 Workshop day 1 - February 23 rd Participants: 9 women 2 volunteers + Karin (Javiera and Maria Jose) We held the first session of the 2-day workshop today. We used the session to build trust and introduce the subject matter on ecofeminism. The session involved introducing the them then reading out loud 4 different poems from The Intersectional Environmentalist, Rupi Kaur and Maya Angelou. There was some area for improvement and some highlights listed below. Highlights: It was great to build on existing behaviors, such as reading texts out loud Showing vulnerability ourselves and personal stories is key to creating a safe space. Building trust to later ask them to write words on their own maternal tongues was also important. Creating poems that are short and easy to understand is key. Karin\u2019s role is vital. She already has trust with them and can dig deeper or get them to participate more. There were some very deep discussions around etymologies of words, such as \u201ccapullo\u201d or \u201ckaur\u201d. Everyone sharing how they say specific words in their own maternal tongue was also a special moment in the dynamic. They\u2019ve never done collage before so they are looking forward to the crafts moment. One personal learning for me was to not over plan the actual workshop and allow for improvisation and for things not being perfect. While this is our first collage intervention we still have time to do a different version with the same community and they are not expecting perfection out of our workshop with them. They are valuing the time and effort we are investing in them and the possibility of learning a new craft and that is something we should honor. Improvements: Space arrangement. We did not have the time or freedom to make a circular space. Asking them how they are feeling didn\u2019t work because of the space arrangement and also felt forced. We could\u2019ve explained what is a collage earlier on for greater clarity. We needed to print more copies of the poems so they could take home. Tomorrow I am looking forward to getting our hands dirty and making the collages. 24 th February Second day collage creation Workshop day 2 - February 24 th Participants: 6 women 1 volunteer Today was the second day of the collage creation workshop at Mam\u00e1s que Leen. We felt much more confident and less nervous this second time even though we had a few material constraints (forgot to bring more scissors, didn\u2019t cut the paper that we were using as base previously). The women also felt much more comfortable participating (one chose to carry on learning Spanish) and the other 6 attendants joined the collage creation. None of them had ever done a collage before and it felt like the appropriate art technique to imagine futures and relations with words. Each woman picked a set of 2 words from the poems we had read out loud the previous day. Some word combinations that were chosen \u201ctranquilidad + calma\u201d, \u201cpoder + cuidado\u201d, \u201cabuelos amor\u201d. Carolina spoke a blend of Portuguese + Spanish and to me that also set the perfect tone since we wanted to create a space of vulnerability, showing how we are all migrants in Spain and how we are all here to learn. We struggled with the space setting since we didn\u2019t want to be placed in a hierarchically higher position than them. Quite the contrary, we wanted to learn from them and hear what they had to say. They started cutting some of the images they picked and with very little needed guidance they each made their own collage. It was beautiful to see their creations. They also were very happy to learn that we would scan them and place the collages in a fanzine. These are the words each participant chose: Karin (fundadora) - Esfuerzo, cambios Khadiza - Tierra, poder Souad - Abuela, ciudado, amor Lina - Poder, Protecci\u00f3n, Placer, Capacidad, Comenzar, Poder Kazi Sonia Alam - Poder, Cuidado Kulwinder Kaur - Plantas y jard\u00edn Bouchra - tranquilidad y paz Materials we printed and used Documented audio files from both days. Karin the founder gave us tulips as a gift for doing the workshop and each participant wrote out our names in their mother tongue. We honestly felt so grateful and that we were receiving much more than we were giving to them. For me it was one of those moments were I felt blessed to be part of something and that I would be willing to repeat this activity even if I were not part of MDEF. When we were walking back home, me and Carolina talked about this feeling of us receiving so much more than we gave and also how these communities that are bottom up are usually much more generous than other more formal ones. We questioned how we can design experiences or interventions where the facilitators (us) are not gaining more out of the exchange. This may benefit our academic careers and help us generate design knowledge, but what we have given to them is enough? We personally feel we are gaining more. Carolina put down our thoughts quite beautifully on her Instagram story. Mamas que leen is an association that teaches immigrant women in El Raval how to read and write in Spanish. We did a co-design exercise on the connection between nature and women. A moment to defy the status quo of the daily life and imagine ecofeminist futures. We learned much more from them than they learned from us. The exchange was not equal. And we are trying to learn how we can build spaces where the exchange of knowledge draws from both sides equally (facilitator and participants). In the photo I am in a different baseline, we tried to diffuse this physical difference (that so often penetrates the perception of someone) by sitting down during the workshop and sharing our own experiences on the different topics. Our role there was not the role of the teacher. It was not easy as the structures of a hierarchy based education (top-down) are deeply infiltrated into everything, from mindsets, table arrangements to available space to freely move and defy stillness. We were struggling to adapt our methods to a space that was created for strict teaching structures. By trying to imagine this new futures we were seeing the present struggles more thoughtfully. To me one of the takeaways was also how to honor that beautiful space that is Mam\u00e1s que Leen. If we were to turn this into a language learning app all the beauty and meaningfulness of the space would be lost. I think the women there value the horizontal space with other women, the cultural and language exchange and also the rich debates they have on topics related to feminism, women\u2019s rights, sexual education. I was pleasantly surprised as to how Karin talks with ease about these subjects with them without imposing her point of view and how these important subjects emerge just on day-to-day Spanish lessons. I hope Mam\u00e1s que leen continues as a space next trimester to see how our intervention can evolve. Me and Carolina were also discussing how we are both interesting in the financial side of supporting these organizations. Can we find ways to help Karin find volunteers? Can we amplify the stories of these women and in turn help them generate financial funds to keep going? FemFabrik \u00b6 Me and Carolina started working on the exhibition for FemFabrik. We wanted to give space to the collages and not to overdesign what is around them. We designed a mock up of what the structure would look like and using Fab lab materials (cardbooard and vinyl cutting). This is what our design looks like. Material prep for Fem Fabrik \u00b6 We experienced a few setbacks during the production and set up of our exhibition because there was an error in scheduling MDEF courses that week. This meant we were only left with Friday afternoon for laser cutting, vinyl cutting and printing. While we were initially frustrated, we managed to iterate the design, set up the files in Rhino and have everything ready for the event. Fem Fabrik - March 11 th \u00b6 On Saturday morning we arrived to have all the materials set up during the event. It was sunny and windy, which meant we struggled with setting up the exhibit space but were finally successful. I found it was a very inspiring event, focused on women and non-binary humans. The energy felt alive in the event and many assistants reached out to us to find out more about the interventions. They also found the collages to be quite beautiful. This was a key moment for us to share back our reactions from the intervention and also help Mamas que Leen reach a bigger audience. We shared photos with Mamas que leen so they could also share on their own social media channels. The main takeaway of the event for me was that this intervention was the only one that addressed women in vulnerable situations and from non European countries. The assistants to the event we talked to were intrigued by the collage results and also started a debate about women\u2019s rights in the SWANA region. Representing the voices of all women is important, especially of those that cannot afford the time and space to attend these types of events. We were particularly cautious of not making our voices be more important than those of las \u201cMam\u00e1s que leen\u201d, which is why the collages were at the forefront of the exhibition space. See a compilation of the collages in PDF. We also made them mobile phone wallpapers. Other activities explored - NonViolent Communication course, salary negotiation experiment and Bologna\u2019s Children Book Fair \u00b6 NonViolent Communication Course at Horta Guinard\u00f3 \u00b6 On January 10 th I attended a Non Violent Communication Course I found through Meetup. My intention was to know more about the methodology and engage with experts that could help me develop a chatbot that uses GPT-3 to heal violent relationships and trauma. I was surprised at the amount of men that were there hoping to have healthier relationships not only with their partners but in general. Mixed crowd, 30-40 range Conducted by expert on NVC and on hiking (2 people) !5 people attended Mixed backgrounds, some were football coaches, consultants. There were 2 men willing to unlearn biases and willing to manage their tempers. They organize 2 day retreats in nature Workshop takeaways: Content itself - very useful and interesting tips to apply in daily life Importance of relation to nature when wanting to unlearn violence Importance of finding strategies that best suit yourself Amount of people interested and willing to learn more, older age too Naming emotions as an exercise and exerting control over your own reactions as one of the keys to Non Violent Communication. More space and time needed for more depth. Exploring GPT3 to combat gender inequality (healing trauma and salary negotiations) \u00b6 For this exploration I will be working with Paula. Paula is an amazing Design Lead with background in political sciences that has worked in initiatives to prevent sexual harassment and to financially empower women through microloans. We will be playing remotely with Chat GPT3 to explore alternative uses of this technology and suggest how this technology can also be better used, considering ethical constraints. I had a co-creating design session with Paula on February 3 rd . We are interested in developing some type of product with a gender lens. You can check out this initial presentation with our emerging ideas. We explored using chat GPT3 for rehearsing important conversations. Some initial learnings from our exploration: Chat GPT3 is not good at providing information beyond what is inputted. Does not offer skills for managing conversations Some interesting findings when inputting CVs with job descriptions Can write cover letters Can outline talking points to make a convincing argument Focus on salary negotiations might be a good starting point considering limitations of the tool You can input performance reviews, emails from bosses, chat conversations We will launch a quick survey to gather ideas on what makes a good salary negotiation. For the survey, I designed an airtable form linked to an airtable gallery card view to enable users to submit answers but also to openly visualize other users\u2019 responses. This is a first probe to see if people are willing to share salary increases publicly and openly, and to see if this is a tool they may also use in these types of negotiations. After publicly sharing the link on Linkedin, with personal colleagues and with communities of designers in Latin America, our next iteration will be to recommend Chat GPT3 use cases to have actual conversations around salary increase with their employers. Even though in my conversation with Tomas he mentioned to just deploy fast and maybe move on to a new experiment, I feel there is potential in these types of tools around salary negotiations, transparency and the potential for financial power being transferred back to women. What do next steps for this look like? Measure traction of surveys and analyze patterns in data (what makes a good salary negotiation?) Share GPT3 tools with community You can see the results we got in this table. The release of the survey allowed me to craft these early insights: A lot of women realized they had never negotiated a salary before so they could not answer the survey. Many men and women are scared of answering surveys because they might lose their job if the employer finds out. Salary negotiation is not only taboo but is also penalized. Women that did fill out the form had to design \u201chacks\u201d to get their salary to be fair and readjusted. i.e. talk about type of contract, ask current employees on Linkedin. Companies lie during the process and don\u2019t disclose salaries. Some opportunity areas: Design for hacks? While tech can help, negotiating salaries has to do with managing culture, making allies and engaging key people in the org to support your raise. I chose to keep this intervention on standby to focus on the other two, but I may resume it in the last trimester. Bologna Book Fair \u00b6 As an early activity to explore my interest in children\u2019s books as a means to actively imagine the future with them, I attended the Bologna Book Fair with Wen as illustrators from March 6 th to 8 th . We also participated by submitting our personal illustrations on the Virtual Illustrators Wall. However, our focus was to be absorbed by the event itself and understand the publishing side of the business and get familiar with editorials all over the world. Some emerging learnings for me were: The emerging genre of silent books (or wordless books) Visual narratives that need no translators as they are designed to be understood without the use of words. Beautiful concept when thinking of imaging futures beyond language. Emotional regulation and soft skills as key themes Children are being actively taught to cope with difficult emotions and are no longer taboo. Alzheimers, depression, grief, war and even rape are some of the subject matters for children\u2019s books. This was surprising to me because when I was younger these are topics that maybe TV shows for teenagers would target but never a cultural product designed for children. Women\u2019s representation - As the event coincided with March 8 th , there was a dedicated section devoted to engaging women in publishers and representing women in different lenses. LGBTQ representation, gender fluidity. These concepts are no longer taboo in certain European countries, though not the case for Asian, Easter and Latin American countries. Using children\u2019s books to talk about tough subjects, build bridges beyond language, engage children with the full human experience. Exploring alternative presents \u00b6 Having absorbed the content from the Futures Talks, as well as my interventions for this second trimester, I feel an overall arch that unites these is using futures literacy with an ecofeminist lens. Solving gender inequalities is actually one of the most effective ways to help combat global warming, and notions of femininity and how it links to our perception of the Earth also relates to how we as humans are damaging the environment. It is quite difficult to separate these concepts and while I was initially not particularly interested in focusing on environment and ecologies, I have found myself immersed in this subject. In relation to the ways of drifting, I feel this Trimester I have had an expansive and a probing approach. Expansive because I have deliberately linked all my interventions to gender equality and probing because I have also allowed myself to flow and find interconnections with my classmates, even pushing some interventions that are more artistic (like the one I did with Carolina and Mam\u00e1s que Leen). Due to this shift in my thinking, I have outlined an alternative present below. Present continuities Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) don\u2019t have allocated time, space or skills to actively imagine future scenarios that are optimistic and also daring. Crafting futures is typically reserved to spaces dominated by capitalist logics of extraction and exclusively reserved to privileged humans that have the space and time to monetize efforts to predict the future, without taking into consideration planetary wellbeing (ecologies) or even the desire and needs of minorities (or feminist perspectives). Alternative present Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) have the tools, skills and designated spaces to not only imagine but actively co-create futures with an ecofeminist perspective. Building futures is an active ongoing exercise that exists in education spaces, inside homes and in social gatherings through collage creation, story building and participatory games that welcome differences of perception and thought. This helps combat echo chambers and filter bubbles since the futures are created welcoming and exploring the complex nuances of difference of thought.","title":"Design studio"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#design-studio-second-trimester","text":"Assignment: Reflect on your and your project\u2019s current stage of development allowing your project to talk back.

After the first trimester I had 3 theories of change I wanted to deep dive further in: What if we imagined an automated chatbot that heals violent relationships and trauma? I learned that healing using GPT3 can sit within ethical borders and it is best to use this technology for actual conversations that will indeed happen in the future. ie. Helping someone practice for a break-up conversation, using chat as a means to teach people about non-violent communication. What if we actively fought gender bias and harassment through machine generated imagery and words? For this one, I wrote a medium article and shared it on my newsletter. While I feel it is a great opportunity area, I feel generating feminist data sets will be a bit too time-consuming considering the time frames of the Master so will put this one on hold. What if we co-created future visions on gender equality with children? I will run a workshop with 75 9-year old children in a school in Badalona with Ariel and Wen.

We visited the school on Wednesday to co-create with the tutor and ask her relevant content questions, how the exercise fits with the regular curricula and what we can change to create more engagement with the children. We decided to ask children more specific questions - i.e. how do you imagine zoos of the future? or parks of the future? or schools of the future? or sports of the future? as opposed to a general \u201cHow do you imagine the future?\u201d question. This specificity will help them be much more concrete with their answers which is rich input for us as designers. As mentioned above, trust building with schools was done through Xavi\u2019s Fab Lab network and took a couple of months to actually schedule the activity. Since schools have to provide a uniform experience for all children in one grade, we needed to replicate the activity with all 75 students and had to run a pretty big pilot.

We felt that teachers felt they could take a break and rest from their busy schedules but were also very interested and curious of the content. Incorporating teachers more actively can be something we can improve later on.

We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incorporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them.

We will test the product with the school we previously worked with but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive. Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers. These types of tools can be easily scaled to schools and taught to teachers to implement in classrooms. We hope this can be a low-tech analog way of fighting back filter bubbles in digital social media, allowing and welcoming difference of thought.","title":"Perception Board (developed during First Fab Lab Challenge)"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#incorporating-a-speaker-mic-to-the-perception-board","text":"This week I worked with Wen and Ariel on designing a complementary product that would amplify the experience of using our Perception Board. While we haven\u2019t had the time and space to test with school students, we still wanted to iterate on the experience to test with both teachers and students during the Third Trimester. For this challenge, we had to incorporate 3D printing, CNC and sensors. This is why we designed a Speaker Mic that would have the objective of helping define who speaks during a classroom session and can design a small ritual around that moment. Some learnings during this challenge listed below: Fabrication processes take a lot of time and efficient time planning is mandatory. During challenges and when working with time constraints, it is best to align fast and then iterate and add more complex systems to the design. Only the 3D printing took over 18 hours. While most processes are digitally fabricated, manual work is very important for incorporating systems and to make sure final adjustments are done correctly. We had to sand manually, put nails on the 3D printed microphone and make a cardboard box by hand to make sure everything worked correctly at the end. Testing with users the final system is equally as important . While these production weeks focused on fabrication help us design the system, it is also important to go back to our communities and test the product and system with them. We are planning on going back to classrooms to test both the perception board and our speaker mics. Incorporate electronics meaningfully. While we can be very drawn to using electronics playfully and introducing a lot of sensors, we chose to make the interaction as simple as possible. This is because using the board in itself is quite complex for children and electronics should help them understand what action is required from them. Building fast allows you to gain a full picture of the system We were happy to see how our Board was nicely integrated at the end with all the elements. This weeks allow us to move forward and not think too much on the design. This I feel was good because it helped us think of the system as a whole and integrating it with the user experience as fast as possible.

She already has trust with them and can dig deeper or get them to participate more. There were some very deep discussions around etymologies of words, such as \u201ccapullo\u201d or \u201ckaur\u201d. Everyone sharing how they say specific words in their own maternal tongue was also a special moment in the dynamic. They\u2019ve never done collage before so they are looking forward to the crafts moment. One personal learning for me was to not over plan the actual workshop and allow for improvisation and for things not being perfect. While this is our first collage intervention we still have time to do a different version with the same community and they are not expecting perfection out of our workshop with them. They are valuing the time and effort we are investing in them and the possibility of learning a new craft and that is something we should honor. Improvements: Space arrangement. We did not have the time or freedom to make a circular space. Asking them how they are feeling didn\u2019t work because of the space arrangement and also felt forced. We could\u2019ve explained what is a collage earlier on for greater clarity. We needed to print more copies of the poems so they could take home. Tomorrow I am looking forward to getting our hands dirty and making the collages. 24 th February Second day collage creation Workshop day 2 - February 24 th Participants: 6 women 1 volunteer Today was the second day of the collage creation workshop at Mam\u00e1s que Leen. We felt much more confident and less nervous this second time even though we had a few material constraints (forgot to bring more scissors, didn\u2019t cut the paper that we were using as base previously). The women also felt much more comfortable participating (one chose to carry on learning Spanish) and the other 6 attendants joined the collage creation. None of them had ever done a collage before and it felt like the appropriate art technique to imagine futures and relations with words. Each woman picked a set of 2 words from the poems we had read out loud the previous day. Some word combinations that were chosen \u201ctranquilidad + calma\u201d, \u201cpoder + cuidado\u201d, \u201cabuelos amor\u201d. Carolina spoke a blend of Portuguese + Spanish and to me that also set the perfect tone since we wanted to create a space of vulnerability, showing how we are all migrants in Spain and how we are all here to learn. We struggled with the space setting since we didn\u2019t want to be placed in a hierarchically higher position than them. Quite the contrary, we wanted to learn from them and hear what they had to say. They started cutting some of the images they picked and with very little needed guidance they each made their own collage. It was beautiful to see their creations. They also were very happy to learn that we would scan them and place the collages in a fanzine. These are the words each participant chose: Karin (fundadora) - Esfuerzo, cambios Khadiza - Tierra, poder Souad - Abuela, ciudado, amor Lina - Poder, Protecci\u00f3n, Placer, Capacidad, Comenzar, Poder Kazi Sonia Alam - Poder, Cuidado Kulwinder Kaur - Plantas y jard\u00edn Bouchra - tranquilidad y paz Materials we printed and used Documented audio files from both days. Karin the founder gave us tulips as a gift for doing the workshop and each participant wrote out our names in their mother tongue. We honestly felt so grateful and that we were receiving much more than we were giving to them. For me it was one of those moments were I felt blessed to be part of something and that I would be willing to repeat this activity even if I were not part of MDEF. When we were walking back home, me and Carolina talked about this feeling of us receiving so much more than we gave and also how these communities that are bottom up are usually much more generous than other more formal ones. We questioned how we can design experiences or interventions where the facilitators (us) are not gaining more out of the exchange. This may benefit our academic careers and help us generate design knowledge, but what we have given to them is enough? We personally feel we are gaining more. Carolina put down our thoughts quite beautifully on her Instagram story. Mamas que leen is an association that teaches immigrant women in El Raval how to read and write in Spanish. We did a co-design exercise on the connection between nature and women. A moment to defy the status quo of the daily life and imagine ecofeminist futures. We learned much more from them than they learned from us. The exchange was not equal. And we are trying to learn how we can build spaces where the exchange of knowledge draws from both sides equally (facilitator and participants). In the photo I am in a different baseline, we tried to diffuse this physical difference (that so often penetrates the perception of someone) by sitting down during the workshop and sharing our own experiences on the different topics. Our role there was not the role of the teacher. It was not easy as the structures of a hierarchy based education (top-down) are deeply infiltrated into everything, from mindsets, table arrangements to available space to freely move and defy stillness. We were struggling to adapt our methods to a space that was created for strict teaching structures. By trying to imagine this new futures we were seeing the present struggles more thoughtfully. To me one of the takeaways was also how to honor that beautiful space that is Mam\u00e1s que Leen. If we were to turn this into a language learning app all the beauty and meaningfulness of the space would be lost. I think the women there value the horizontal space with other women, the cultural and language exchange and also the rich debates they have on topics related to feminism, women\u2019s rights, sexual education. I was pleasantly surprised as to how Karin talks with ease about these subjects with them without imposing her point of view and how these important subjects emerge just on day-to-day Spanish lessons. I hope Mam\u00e1s que leen continues as a space next trimester to see how our intervention can evolve. Me and Carolina were also discussing how we are both interesting in the financial side of supporting these organizations. Can we find ways to help Karin find volunteers? Can we amplify the stories of these women and in turn help them generate financial funds to keep going?","title":"Workshop - 2 sessions"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#femfabrik","text":"Me and Carolina started working on the exhibition for FemFabrik.

It was sunny and windy, which meant we struggled with setting up the exhibit space but were finally successful. I found it was a very inspiring event, focused on women and non-binary humans. The energy felt alive in the event and many assistants reached out to us to find out more about the interventions. They also found the collages to be quite beautiful. This was a key moment for us to share back our reactions from the intervention and also help Mamas que Leen reach a bigger audience. We shared photos with Mamas que leen so they could also share on their own social media channels. The main takeaway of the event for me was that this intervention was the only one that addressed women in vulnerable situations and from non European countries. The assistants to the event we talked to were intrigued by the collage results and also started a debate about women\u2019s rights in the SWANA region. Representing the voices of all women is important, especially of those that cannot afford the time and space to attend these types of events. We were particularly cautious of not making our voices be more important than those of las \u201cMam\u00e1s que leen\u201d, which is why the collages were at the forefront of the exhibition space. See a compilation of the collages in PDF. We also made them mobile phone wallpapers.","title":"Fem Fabrik - March 11th"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#other-activities-explored-nonviolent-communication-course-salary-negotiation-experiment-and-bolognas-children-book-fair","text":"","title":"Other activities explored - NonViolent Communication course, salary negotiation experiment and Bologna\u2019s Children Book Fair"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#nonviolent-communication-course-at-horta-guinardo","text":"On January 10 th I attended a Non Violent Communication Course I found through Meetup.

Paula is an amazing Design Lead with background in political sciences that has worked in initiatives to prevent sexual harassment and to financially empower women through microloans. We will be playing remotely with Chat GPT3 to explore alternative uses of this technology and suggest how this technology can also be better used, considering ethical constraints. I had a co-creating design session with Paula on February 3 rd . We are interested in developing some type of product with a gender lens. You can check out this initial presentation with our emerging ideas. We explored using chat GPT3 for rehearsing important conversations. Some initial learnings from our exploration: Chat GPT3 is not good at providing information beyond what is inputted. Does not offer skills for managing conversations Some interesting findings when inputting CVs with job descriptions Can write cover letters Can outline talking points to make a convincing argument Focus on salary negotiations might be a good starting point considering limitations of the tool You can input performance reviews, emails from bosses, chat conversations We will launch a quick survey to gather ideas on what makes a good salary negotiation. For the survey, I designed an airtable form linked to an airtable gallery card view to enable users to submit answers but also to openly visualize other users\u2019 responses. This is a first probe to see if people are willing to share salary increases publicly and openly, and to see if this is a tool they may also use in these types of negotiations. After publicly sharing the link on Linkedin, with personal colleagues and with communities of designers in Latin America, our next iteration will be to recommend Chat GPT3 use cases to have actual conversations around salary increase with their employers. Even though in my conversation with Tomas he mentioned to just deploy fast and maybe move on to a new experiment, I feel there is potential in these types of tools around salary negotiations, transparency and the potential for financial power being transferred back to women. What do next steps for this look like? Measure traction of surveys and analyze patterns in data (what makes a good salary negotiation?) Share GPT3 tools with community You can see the results we got in this table. The release of the survey allowed me to craft these early insights: A lot of women realized they had never negotiated a salary before so they could not answer the survey. Many men and women are scared of answering surveys because they might lose their job if the employer finds out. Salary negotiation is not only taboo but is also penalized. Women that did fill out the form had to design \u201chacks\u201d to get their salary to be fair and readjusted. i.e. talk about type of contract, ask current employees on Linkedin. Companies lie during the process and don\u2019t disclose salaries. Some opportunity areas: Design for hacks? While tech can help, negotiating salaries has to do with managing culture, making allies and engaging key people in the org to support your raise. I chose to keep this intervention on standby to focus on the other two, but I may resume it in the last trimester.","title":"Exploring GPT3 to combat gender inequality (healing trauma and salary negotiations)"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#bologna-book-fair","text":"As an early activity to explore my interest in children\u2019s books as a means to actively imagine the future with them, I attended the Bologna Book Fair with Wen as illustrators from March 6 th to 8 th . We also participated by submitting our personal illustrations on the Virtual Illustrators Wall. However, our focus was to be absorbed by the event itself and understand the publishing side of the business and get familiar with editorials all over the world. Some emerging learnings for me were: The emerging genre of silent books (or wordless books) Visual narratives that need no translators as they are designed to be understood without the use of words. Beautiful concept when thinking of imaging futures beyond language. Emotional regulation and soft skills as key themes Children are being actively taught to cope with difficult emotions and are no longer taboo. Alzheimers, depression, grief, war and even rape are some of the subject matters for children\u2019s books. This was surprising to me because when I was younger these are topics that maybe TV shows for teenagers would target but never a cultural product designed for children. Women\u2019s representation - As the event coincided with March 8 th , there was a dedicated section devoted to engaging women in publishers and representing women in different lenses. LGBTQ representation, gender fluidity. These concepts are no longer taboo in certain European countries, though not the case for Asian, Easter and Latin American countries. Using children\u2019s books to talk about tough subjects, build bridges beyond language, engage children with the full human experience.","title":"Bologna Book Fair"},{"location":"term2/02-Design%20Studio/#exploring-alternative-presents","text":"Having absorbed the content from the Futures Talks, as well as my interventions for this second trimester, I feel an overall arch that unites these is using futures literacy with an ecofeminist lens. Solving gender inequalities is actually one of the most effective ways to help combat global warming, and notions of femininity and how it links to our perception of the Earth also relates to how we as humans are damaging the environment. It is quite difficult to separate these concepts and while I was initially not particularly interested in focusing on environment and ecologies, I have found myself immersed in this subject. In relation to the ways of drifting, I feel this Trimester I have had an expansive and a probing approach. Expansive because I have deliberately linked all my interventions to gender equality and probing because I have also allowed myself to flow and find interconnections with my classmates, even pushing some interventions that are more artistic (like the one I did with Carolina and Mam\u00e1s que Leen). Due to this shift in my thinking, I have outlined an alternative present below. Present continuities Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) don\u2019t have allocated time, space or skills to actively imagine future scenarios that are optimistic and also daring. Crafting futures is typically reserved to spaces dominated by capitalist logics of extraction and exclusively reserved to privileged humans that have the space and time to monetize efforts to predict the future, without taking into consideration planetary wellbeing (ecologies) or even the desire and needs of minorities (or feminist perspectives). Alternative present Citizens in Barcelona like myself (and especially younger generations and migrants) have the tools, skills and designated spaces to not only imagine but actively co-create futures with an ecofeminist perspective. Building futures is an active ongoing exercise that exists in education spaces, inside homes and in social gatherings through collage creation, story building and participatory games that welcome differences of perception and thought. This helps combat echo chambers and filter bubbles since the futures are created welcoming and exploring the complex nuances of difference of thought.","title":"Exploring alternative presents"},{"location":"term2/03-Remixing%20materials/","text":"Remixing materials \u00b6 This week we deep dived on remixing materials with a particular point of view on growing materials from nature (such as mycelium) and using waste for designing with circularity. One of the highlights for me was the possibility of using waste as input and then mixing the process with other tools such as 3D printing or using moulds to create new objects. Remixing materials is an important part of achieving a more sustainable, circular economy. Remixing materials also allows us to create innovative new materials from existing organic and waste materials. This helps to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with manufacturing new materials from scratch. Remixing materials can also help to create more affordable, custom-made products, reducing the cost of goods and making them more accessible to everyone. Furthermore, remixing materials can enable more creative and sustainable design solutions, allowing designers to find new and innovative ways to reduce our impact on the environment. Our material exploration: Remixing orange peels \u00b6 During the following classes we became familiarized with moulding, 3D printing and ways to create our own moulds.

Me, Ariel and Wen decided to experiment with orange peel during the second week as a means to explore new material applications and the possibility of building a compostable product. We were inspired by all the orange peel leftovers from the \u201cZumos de Naranjas\u201d consumed during breakfast in Barcelona and self-served in stores and supermarkets such as Mercadona. One of our initial questions we asked was: What if the vase that contained the orange juice was made out of peel instead of plastic? Process-wise, we decided to use a recipe that was compostable with the aim of creating flower pots that could then be re planted in soil and contribute to fertility. We used varying levels of water in our recipes to contrast what generated the most suitable texture.

Micro challenge 1 Learning to activate music with a buzzer using our electronic kit. \u00b6 This was my first time operating Arduino by myself. In Tech beyond the myth I worked with experts on my team so I was in charge of the communications aspect. Wen lent me here Arduino Uno which was a great starting point because its especially designed to teach children in high school to approach Arduino. I started looking at open source libraries with different music tracks, such as Harry Potter, Ed Sheeran songs and The Pink Panther theme song.

Experiments with music playing with Arduino Uno. Experiments with music playing with Arduino Uno. Week 1 - Day 2 \u00b6 Today Eduardo taught us more about modelling and 3D models. He started by introducing terminology such as pixels vs vectors and going to basics allowed all of us to start with a clear mind. One of the technical highlights for me was learning the importance of reducing image file sizes when uploading them to a website and being mindful of the ecological impact of not doing this. Micro challenge 2.1 Parametrizing a croissant \u00b6 I asked Chat GPT3 to parametrize a croissant since I have zero experience with modeling and 3D software besides 3Ds max when I was doing an animation class on product advertising. First I used Noun Project to look for 2D croissant vectors. I then looked for open Rhino libraries that would allow me to look for different croissant models. I downloaded one that looked the most simple and opened it up on Rhino. Micro challenge 2.2 Create a 3D design based on algorithmic thinking of any object or concept you like. \u00b6 This was very exciting for me because I have zero experience modelling but the tools are very accesible. I was interested in exploring how to do 3D models of illustrations and logotypes and deep dive on that a bit more. I really like the work of Cabeza Patata, an illustration collective that does 3D renderings of illustrations. The software I chose was Blender, I wanted to get familiar with the tool and saw there was a very big internet community offering free tutorials. I started first watching introductory tutorials that showed me keyboard shortcuts and the logic behind the tool. I wanted to create a 3D version of a logotype I had created for a client last year. I chose that image because the shape is pretty simple and would have a potential use if I sent it back to the client. I made this video outlining the end result and sharing a bit of my process. I learned to use the Boolean tool as a means to cut shapes inside the 3D model. The logic to me was very familiar as this is a technique I used when playing around with 2D vectors and typography. I am really content with the end result even though I know it is quite basic. This made me aware that my interest in 3D modeling is more connected to illustration and branding rather than to engineering or making products. I also tried to input \u201c3D render letter M\u201d on stable diffusion to see how the AI generated models looked like and how much they could serve me for this purpose. Week 2 - Day 1 \u00b6 Today we learned about laser cutting and vinyl cutting. What resonated with me most was the application of these techniques for building installations and communicating ideas in spaces. Using pens with the vinyl cutter was also incredible, a way to mix an analog and traditional technique with the digital. Micro challenge 3 Create a parametric model and print it. \u00b6 To explore laser cutting press-fit for the first time I chose to build out of an existing file of a cat. I then modified the file size a bit to fit the laser cut machine and added my name to personalize the cat. What was hardest of the process was setting up the properties on the laser cut machine to have the correct scale, position the laser in the right corner and understanding the colors for engraving and cutting. I set up the file with Wen and Carolina and we needed to ask Eduardo and Josep for help a couple of times. We used some spare cardboard that had already been used for our initial prototypes before using a fancier cardboard for the end result. While testing out the final materials the press fit was right on point for the cat but not so much for the airplane I also printed out on cardboard. This was because the model was too small and the material was not rigid enough. For the future I would love to explore using laster cutting for exhibit design mixing engraving with cut parts using negative space for typography. Week 2 - Day 2 \u00b6 We learned about inputs and outputs from Victor. It was very inspiring to learn how sensors such as GPS actually work and to see the potential of using sensors in fields such as biology where electronics has not been very funded or investigated much before. I also enjoyed learning about DIY communities in Japan where making your own input and output systems is a great way to also combat private corporations using personal data for their own gain. Some questions asked during class that resonate with me: Why is Alexa so cheap if the investment for its development was so expensive? Answer: potentially they want to aim for the most quantity of Alexa\u2019s per household to gain our data and use that for profit. The list of sensors and potential inputs was also very exhaustive and allwoed us as a group to push our thinking into what we can begin to monitor, especially for groups looking at collaboration with nature and water. Micro challenge 4 Arduino challenge inputs and outputs \u00b6 For this challenge I came to IAAC with Carolina, Wen, Sami and Josephine on Friday. We tried to individually set up our Arduinos to either light up the LED with the switch and to use the sensor correctly on a separate board. We realized this task would take us much more time than we initially thought. I worked with Carolina trying to connect the switch to the LED light and were succesful for a period of time but then the Arduino stopped working. We tried plugging and re plugging everything but it didn\u2019t work again. Finally we got the board to keep working and focused on integrating our output with the sensor Sami and Josephine had been working on. We had fun seeing how far we could go on connecting both systems.

If it is, the buttonState is HIGH: if (buttonState == HIGH) { // turn LED on: digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH); Week 3 - First Fab Lab challenge \u00b6 This week I worked with Ariel and Wen to develop a physical product that would allow us to engage with children\u2019s perceptions in relation to 3 different fields: climate change, gender equality and mental health. We were inspired by analog data visualizations and an exercise we did with Holon during the Community Engagement week where we had to physically move our body along an x and y spectrum to show how we felt in regards to certain topics. We decided to go big on format to make it more accessible for children and to include emojis as a way to also start destigmatizing emotions. One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incoporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. My participation in the project was primarily in designing the concept and MVP in digital format, looking at how the user interaction would work inside a classroom and how would the use of the Perception Board work integrating the cards, questions and the x and y axis. I then designed the question cards, iterating the content itself so it would be more understandable by children. My role was also to help set up the laser cutting and help Ariel and Wen finalize Rhino file details and pasting the parts of the final piece together with glue. We will test the product with the school we previously worked but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. What our final board looked like after connecting a circuit and coding Arduino for LED lights to switch on using a button. What our product looked like after a hands-on week of a lot of iterations, learnings and testing out new things. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers. Project repo Week 3 - Day 1 \u00b6 We started this week with an introduction by Eduardo on 3D printing and 3D scanning technologies. We were exposed to a recap of the history of 3D printing and given an overview of different ways to engage with 3D technology nowadays. We were also provided with actionable tips to 3D scan ourselves using software that is freely available and understanding what we can do with 3D scanned data (i.e. understand volume of material we require after 3D scan). Micro challenge 5 3D printing and scanning \u00b6 For this challenge I chose to 3D print a pencil holder looking at 3D libraries available online with files ready for printing. I chose Thingverse because it had a variety of options and I was looking to print something functional that I would intentionally use at home and would therefore not be wasteful. I first started looking up for vases online that had organic shapes in the edges. I then had to install Windows 3D viewer to be able to preview the files and make modifications so it could be printed at IAAC. I installed Cura on my computer following the Fab Lab Video were Julia shows the instructions on how to 3D print. I sliced my original pencil holder but it showed 3 hours to print so I iterated to picking another easier and smaller object. I chose a ring. I then opened the file on Ultimaker cura. I had to iterate the chosen file because of its size. To print this file it would take 4 hours 27 minutes. This ring was the chosen alternative. It was more time-efficient with only 7 minutes to print. For printing, we did a first try with Wen and Sami and we had help from someone from Fab Lab. We had to change the temperature to 215 from 200 degrees celsius and change the quality from Low to Standard. This allowed us to print correctly. We set up the printer using Auto settings. Waiting for the ring to print. Printed ring. For 3D scanning I used the app Polycam. I realized early on that the ring\u2019s size is too small for scanning so I tried scanning the ring with my hand to be able to get a correct scan. Failed scan of the ring after several attempts and trying out different apps. This is my end result. It was a failure because it is too small and I tried adding a big object underneath but was still unable to properly scan. So instead I tried 3D scanning a bigger different object to see if I would be successful this time around. I then tried scanning my water bottle and camera bag. Because of the bigger size, I got a much closer scan. Week 3 - Day 2 \u00b6 Today\u2019s class Victor shared information about the origin of the internet and helped debunk myths about how the \u201ccloud\u201d works or how servers and data is actually stored physically and mostly in California. What resonated with me most were examples such as Gemini network or Proton email that helped me broaden my horizons as to what safe navigation or data sharing can look like. Micro challenge 6 Connecting Arduino to wifi server \u00b6 For this micro challenge I worked with Ariel trying to set up the Arduino to the server. We inputted the code listed below. We embedded the code listed below. This is the code I inputted into Arduino #include #include const char* ssid = \u201cIaac-Wifi\u201d; const char* password = \u201cEnterIaac22@\u201d; WiFiClient wifiClient; const char* mqttBroker = \u201c172.16.10.224\u201d; const char* mqttClientName = \u201cjimena\u201d; const char* topicToSub = \u201cteamx/in\u201d; const char* topicToPub = \u201cteamx/out\u201d; PubSubClient mqttClient(wifiClient); const int buttPin = 6; bool buttState; void mqttConnect() { while (!mqttClient.connected()) { Serial.print(\u201cAttempting MQTT connection\u2026\u201d); if (mqttClient.connect(mqttClientName)) { Serial.println(\u201cconnected\u201d); mqttClient.publish(\u201chello\u201d, mqttClientName); // Topic(s) subscription mqttClient.subscribe(topicToSub); } else { Serial.print(\u201cfailed, rc=\u201d); Serial.print(mqttClient.state()); Serial.println(\u201d try again in 5 seconds\u201d); delay(5000); } } } void callback(char* topic, byte* message, unsigned int length) { String receivedMsg; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { receivedMsg += (char)message[i]; } Serial.print(\u201cMessage arrived on topic: \u201c); Serial.print(topic); Serial.print(\u201c.

We had to iterate the numbers to get the correct numbers a couple of times and the code wouldn\u2019t run. We were then successful in connecting and created a channel called \u201cAriel\u201d. We were successful in connecting. Some messages we received from Victor. Week 4 - Day 1 \u00b6 Today Oscar showed us different ways to code a LED light using the ESP32 feather board. Also integrating pre existing libraries to generate different non-uniform ways to make the LED light blink. The class was very practical. We also learned about MQTT-Broker servers and did a collective exercise of synchronizing our LED lights. Another concept that brought my attention was \u201cRaspberry pi\u201d (Single Board Computer), which is a very simple computer or a more complex Arduino. Micro challenge 7 Synching LED lights through Arduino Server \u00b6 During the class, we learned different modes of turning on LED lights such as blink and candle. This is our class with the lights off synching our Arduino LED lights together. To me this was a very compelling and easy to understand step by step to using LEDs. During the microchallenge, we incorporated LEDs and had a hard time just turning them on in the most basic function. LED light slowly burning. Synched LED lights being operated through server. Week 4 - Day 2 \u00b6 Edu gave a lecture on CNC machines and types of motors. We were given tips on how to manage the files, how to operate the machine and how to deal with the material and cutting with the tool. We also learned about processes such as nesting that avoids material waste (using online programs such as svgnest). He also deep dived on security and how this is vital when working with CNC. Our plan is to use the CNC machine as an \u201cadd-on\u201d to our Perception Board. The board needs a small table that allows children to view it standing up, so we will use our wood material to execute this complementary table. Micro challenge 8 Using CNC to build a card holder \u00b6 Me and Ariel and Wen had aligned on that we wanted to build a card holder out of CNC to use with our Perception Board during the Second Fab Lab Challenge. While the card holder is a complementary accesory to the overall experience, we felt the holder could really add comfort to children while interacting with our device and help them focus on the question being discussed. For the fabrication process, we had Edu\u2019s help with the set up of the CNC machine ensuring the thickness of the material (wood) and exporting the file to a code the CNC machine could read. For this exploration it was interesting to choose thick wood with carvings instead of thinner wood with press fit. We had to sand the final card holder. We were told by Edu that we had to sand for quite a while until the surface was smooth. Week 5 - Second Fab Lab challenge \u00b6 This week I worked with Wen and Ariel on designing a complementary product that would amplify the experience of using our Perception Board. While we haven\u2019t had the time and space to test with school students, we still wanted to iterate on the experience to test with both teachers and students during the Third Trimester. For this challenge, we had to incorporate 3D printing, CNC and sensors. This is why we designed a Speaker Mic that would have the objective of helping define who speaks during a classroom session and can design a small ritual around that moment. Some learnings during this challenge listed below: Fabrication processes take a lot of time and efficient time planning is mandatory. During challenges and when working with time constraints, it is best to align fast and then iterate and add more complex systems to the design. Only the 3D printing took over 18 hours. While most processes are digitally fabricated, manual work is very important for incorporating systems and to make sure final adjustments are done correctly. We had to sand manually, put nails on the 3D printed microphone and make a cardboard box by hand to make sure everything worked correctly at the end. Testing with users the final system is equally as important . While these production weeks focused on fabrication help us design the system, it is also important to go back to our communities and test the product and system with them. We are planning on going back to classrooms to test both the perception board and our speaker mics. Incorporate electronics meaningfully. While we can be very drawn to using electronics playfully and introducing a lot of sensors, we chose to make the interaction as simple as possible. This is because using the board in itself is quite complex for children and electronics should help them understand what action is required from them. Building fast allows you to gain a full picture of the system We were happy to see how our Board was nicely integrated at the end with all the elements. This weeks allow us to move forward and not think too much on the design. This I feel was good because it helped us think of the system as a whole and integrating it with the user experience as fast as possible. One of the feedback we received from Santi was that our classmates gathered around when we showed our artifact which we can take as a positive signal that high school students might be equally as engaged.

One of the highlights for me was how fast we aligned on the subject matter and concept of the proposal. As early feedback we were suggested to incoporate electronics to our product that would be fabricated mostly using laser cutting. We used the first day to brainstorm some ideas that would not be time consuming and would above all be very meaningful for both the product and the facilitation behind it. My participation in the project was primarily in designing the concept and MVP in digital format, looking at how the user interaction would work inside a classroom and how would the use of the Perception Board work integrating the cards, questions and the x and y axis. I then designed the question cards, iterating the content itself so it would be more understandable by children. My role was also to help set up the laser cutting and help Ariel and Wen finalize Rhino file details and pasting the parts of the final piece together with glue. We will test the product with the school we previously worked but this time with older children since the exercise requires more cognitive skills and debate capabilities from them. What our final board looked like after connecting a circuit and coding Arduino for LED lights to switch on using a button. What our product looked like after a hands-on week of a lot of iterations, learnings and testing out new things. Some learnings that emerged from this week: Electronics require a lot of time and that should be reflected on the planning side of managing time. Colored LED lights also use different resistors and when lighting up many LEDs on one same product the amount of power is something to take into account. When making different prototypes, take notes of changes in materials, design files and extra pieces you will need for next time or round of iteration. For instance, by making the cardboard design we realized we need a card holder to place all the cards inside, some way to transport the board to schools and a taller structure to hide the Arduino set up from children. We also want to explore using LED strips as opposed to LED bulbs. Laser cutting is also very time-sensitive Make sure that happens earlier on you work flow because laser cutting two wooden boards can take over an hour between cutting time and setting up the file time. Early alignment is key. Had we not aligned on Tuesday on the output and key concept we would not have had time to fail early building the actual product and iterating. I am looking forward to using our Perception board with teenagers and seeing how this project can also evolve in designing DIY tools for teachers to facilitate participatory processes with children and teenagers.

I chose Thingverse because it had a variety of options and I was looking to print something functional that I would intentionally use at home and would therefore not be wasteful. I first started looking up for vases online that had organic shapes in the edges. I then had to install Windows 3D viewer to be able to preview the files and make modifications so it could be printed at IAAC. I installed Cura on my computer following the Fab Lab Video were Julia shows the instructions on how to 3D print. I sliced my original pencil holder but it showed 3 hours to print so I iterated to picking another easier and smaller object. I chose a ring. I then opened the file on Ultimaker cura. I had to iterate the chosen file because of its size. To print this file it would take 4 hours 27 minutes. This ring was the chosen alternative. It was more time-efficient with only 7 minutes to print. For printing, we did a first try with Wen and Sami and we had help from someone from Fab Lab. We had to change the temperature to 215 from 200 degrees celsius and change the quality from Low to Standard. This allowed us to print correctly. We set up the printer using Auto settings. Waiting for the ring to print. Printed ring. For 3D scanning I used the app Polycam. I realized early on that the ring\u2019s size is too small for scanning so I tried scanning the ring with my hand to be able to get a correct scan. Failed scan of the ring after several attempts and trying out different apps. This is my end result. It was a failure because it is too small and I tried adding a big object underneath but was still unable to properly scan. So instead I tried 3D scanning a bigger different object to see if I would be successful this time around. I then tried scanning my water bottle and camera bag. Because of the bigger size, I got a much closer scan.","title":"Micro challenge 5 3D printing and scanning"},{"location":"term2/04-Prototyping%20for%20Design/#week-3-day-2","text":"Today\u2019s class Victor shared information about the origin of the internet and helped debunk myths about how the \u201ccloud\u201d works or how servers and data is actually stored physically and mostly in California.

While we haven\u2019t had the time and space to test with school students, we still wanted to iterate on the experience to test with both teachers and students during the Third Trimester. For this challenge, we had to incorporate 3D printing, CNC and sensors. This is why we designed a Speaker Mic that would have the objective of helping define who speaks during a classroom session and can design a small ritual around that moment. Some learnings during this challenge listed below: Fabrication processes take a lot of time and efficient time planning is mandatory. During challenges and when working with time constraints, it is best to align fast and then iterate and add more complex systems to the design. Only the 3D printing took over 18 hours. While most processes are digitally fabricated, manual work is very important for incorporating systems and to make sure final adjustments are done correctly. We had to sand manually, put nails on the 3D printed microphone and make a cardboard box by hand to make sure everything worked correctly at the end. Testing with users the final system is equally as important . While these production weeks focused on fabrication help us design the system, it is also important to go back to our communities and test the product and system with them. We are planning on going back to classrooms to test both the perception board and our speaker mics. Incorporate electronics meaningfully. While we can be very drawn to using electronics playfully and introducing a lot of sensors, we chose to make the interaction as simple as possible. This is because using the board in itself is quite complex for children and electronics should help them understand what action is required from them. Building fast allows you to gain a full picture of the system We were happy to see how our Board was nicely integrated at the end with all the elements. This weeks allow us to move forward and not think too much on the design. This I feel was good because it helped us think of the system as a whole and integrating it with the user experience as fast as possible. One of the feedback we received from Santi was that our classmates gathered around when we showed our artifact which we can take as a positive signal that high school students might be equally as engaged.

To further comprehend the potential of design to reconfigure systems of extraction, it is essential to consider who is defining design, where they are located geographically and how they were given authority in a social context to act as definers. However, if we are to consider that every human being can potentially be a designer and is not a title or a field exclusive to architects, visual designers and product designers, history should go back to pre-Colonial times to understand how design has emerged as a field outside academia.The book \u201cLo-TEK: Design by Radical Indigenism\u201d by Julia Watson was personally a good starting point to understand how indigenous communities have developed low-technology solutions to real-world problems, working in tandem with nature rather than exploiting it. As someone born in Peru and having traveled to Cusco many times, I have been able to observe how the Inca culture created their own laboratory (Moray) to determine the best conditions for cultivating different agricultural products in the Andean region. Additionally, reciprocity was a common way for the Inca community to exchange knowledge for goods and services or for trading commodities or favors. Societies that experiment and prototype at a community level have long existed as well as ways to exchange value without money being the default. Colonization and industrialization has shifted the design practice to seek reduction of costs, optimization of processes and efficiency as a norm that has dominated the latest centuries. Very recently, \u201cuser-centricity\u201d, as mentioned by Kevin Slavin in his \u201cDesign as participation\u201d article, is depicted as an alternative that seeks to satisfy user\u2019s desires and is accompanied by buzzwords such as \u201cdesign thinking\u201d and \u201cinnovation.\u201d However, this concept still complies with logics of efficiency, velocity seeking and growth optimizing ways of relating with the world as we seek to please the customer with the purchasing power. We do not need to produce more goods, fabricate artificially more user needs or develop new technology with the aim of stimulating demand. From a planetary perspective, we need minds thinking of new ways to go back to pre-Colonial ways of engaging with the World and coexisting within planetary boundaries. This is a complex task, as it requires a delicate balancing of cultural appropriation and the need to start difficult conversations in Eurocentric spaces. As Slavin mentioned in his article \u201cthe lens of the user obscures the view of the ecosystems it affects\u201d and we need to start drawing from ecosystemic perspectives to reconfigure systems of extraction. Which worlds can we design with the power of today\u2019s tools? \u00b6 When considering how to create more hopeful futures through the deliberate application of current technology, I am drawn to language, which plays a critical role in the formation and propagation of current ideologies and discourses. Rather than devising new technologies, which has been known to exacerbate existing prejudices such as AI, I propose that we turn to existing technology and use it deliberately to bring about change. As inaction results in no transformation, we must be prepared to dream of new, better worlds. One thing MDEF has taught me recently is the importance of futures literacy and the importance of daring to imagine a future that is better, more ambitious, more sustainable and more inclusive. Reading \u201cA History of the World in Seven Cheap Things\u201d by Raj Patel and Jason W.Moore, one vital takeaway is to shift from Eurocentric worldviews, integrate indigenous perspectives and rethink our relationship to nature. For designers, one suggested tool is to abandon dichotomous thinking, particularly Man-Nature distinctions. While concepts such as biomimicry are becoming more popular, it is important to be mindful of not simply copying the design principles of nature, but rather thinking of nature as an active participant in everything we design that is also directly impacted by this. Reading Gregory Bateson has been key in reshaping the significance of language and reflecting on the philosophy of how we organize words, compile items, and utilize language as a tool to start comprehending and making sense of the world. If we don\u2019t sit back with these bigger, broader questions we may lose the ability to think critically about other ways we relate with the world. His philosophy is especially relevant with the abrupt increase in generative and synthetic tools such as AI and ML which now allow humans to access tools such as chat GPT-3 and Midjourney creating text and images within seconds. Humans should now also learn to be critical about today\u2019s tools and develop more acute ways of identifying deepfakes and biases deeply ingrained in the datasets that allow these technologies to exist in the first place. A personal takeaway for me, as a Peruvian designer, is to allow humans the materiality of space and time to think about the future. In the Global South, urgency, designing for survival and short-termism does not allow space for greater questions. By contrast, in Europe there is a greater focus on designing with nature and looking to the future as a new area of exploration. Latin America is focused on ensuring survival and generating the necessary economic resources to make it to the next day. A recent debate in class pointed out how some problems are over-funded and others are under-funded, depending on what is trending because funding is still a colonial legacy. This dependency on funding generates added instability in the Global South. Designing new worlds should also begin to incorporate principles of justice and rethinking how we allow resources and initiatives to continue existing beyond funding. How can we design the transition towards these worlds? \u00b6 I believe a good starting point to transition towards these worlds is to involve humans and non-humans in spaces where the future is being envisioned. Skills such as futures literacy are crucial because our end point and collective vision should involve the perspectives of every human (and non-human species) equally, avoiding Euro-centrism, poor racial misrepresentation and excluding key communities and ecologies. Designing for transitions also means letting go of Western notions of designing time. Our future or transitions may not necessarily be \u201cahead of us\u201d but are rather consistently shaped by the stories we tell ourselves of our past. The role of memory in a designers toolkit is also vital. A memory that is constantly exercised, rewritten and that can be constantly challenged by new generations. To me, it is astounding how Colonization is much more recent in our history than we as a species would like to admit and thus we should actively cooperate to mitigate its legacies and redesign new ways of relating between nations, or even naming our streets. This is particularly relevant as in Barcelona I find monuments dedicated to colonizers. Personally I think this non-Euro-centric utopia seems challenging because it is hard to reimagine capitalism since it is a system that permeates everything. It is impossible to design \u201coutside\u201d of it when we find ourselves so ingrained within it. One of the most important challenges now is how we go from imagining or proposing futures to actually building them in the present. This Master\u2019s is a great opportunity to get our hands dirty and fail early as well. However, re-thinking how we monetize, finance and allow humans working in this space to make a living out of these efforts is also something that needs to be taken into account. Otherwise, these spaces will continue being spaces of privilege. Beyond re-thinking the design process, I personally think some systems and key indicators need to be urgently reconfigured such as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the norm for measuring a country\u2019s success, integrating planetary indicators, as is a comprehensive overhaul of the educational system. Discourses should be crafted to challenge efficiency-seeking to the detriment of the planet\u2019s wellbeing. A tool that helps me as a designer is to ask myself questions like: Who is funding this project? Who are they trying to impress to get more money? What are their own incentives for working on this project? When designing behavioral change, it is essential to look beyond what is being designed and to be self-critical. If, for example, one is a Master\u2019s student within a design education institution, it is important to consider one\u2019s own incentives, such as achieving a good grade, impressing professors and maximizing the communication of one\u2019s impact. This will enable an analytical outlook of what is being designed and, most importantly, why. Positionality statements are a first step towards incorporating these perspectives, urging researchers and authors to achieve increased self-awareness of what viewpoints or biases they are bringing into a discussion and to make these transparent. Another personal takeaway is how \u201cthe personal is political\u201d and the decisions we make as individuals, while may not be enough to shift or alter our imminent planetary destruction, can be a way for us to try to \u201clive the values\u201d we seek to find in the present and in the future. Through the use of first person perspective design, it is possible to envision particular futures, while also being aware of the challenges of changing present behaviors and understanding why individuals may choose routes that are not the most carbon-efficient. For example, if we want to travel in an eco-friendly way to an island that is thousands of kilometers away, a boat might be the best option. However when time is being monetized and is scarce, spending over thirty hours on a boat becomes something you think twice and in reality not a viable option. I recently read a Victor Papanek quote that says \u201cthe main trouble with design schools seems to be that they teach too much design and not enough about the social and political environment in which design takes place\u201d. I think one of the first steps to transitioning to new worlds is to step back and go back to simplicity, frugality, humility and not getting drowned in intellectualizing the future but start designing it today with intention. Further exploration \u00b6 I asked chat GPT to simulate a debate between Raj Patel, Gregory Bateson and a hypothetical Master\u2019s student. While the result was not an ongoing conversation, it was able to highlight the main political point of view of each of the authors and what they would bring to a conversation about rethinking design systems. PROMPT: Create a debate between Raj Patel, Gregory Bateson and a Master\u2019s Design student about reimagining design systems. Raj Patel: We should be reimagining design systems to better serve people and the planet. Design systems should be designed to reduce resource consumption, minimize waste, and create products and services that are both sustainable and equitable. We should also be looking for ways to make design systems more scalable and accessible. Gregory Bateson: I agree that we should be rethinking design systems to better serve people and the planet. We should also be looking for ways to make design systems more responsive to changing circumstances and to feedback from users so that they can be more effective in meeting the needs of those they are designed to serve. We should also be looking for ways to make design systems more equitable and inclusive, so that all users have access to the same resources and opportunities. Masters Design Student: I agree that we should be reimagining design systems to better serve people and the planet. We could look to nature for inspiration and design systems that are holistically integrated and self-sustaining. We should also be looking for ways to make design systems more creative, innovative, and adaptive. We should also ensure that design systems are accessible and equitable, so that everyone can benefit from their use. 1960 words","title":"Making sense and meaning"},{"location":"term2/07-Making%20sense%20and%20meaning/#making-sense-and-meaning","text":"During these seminars we were challenged to rethink design from an Academic Eurocentric pe rspective and broaden our definitions, while also thinking of the impact of other disciplines in the design field and even engage in philosophical discussions around making meaning with the help of external guests in the design field.","title":"Making sense and meaning"},{"location":"term2/07-Making%20sense%20and%20meaning/#essay","text":"To write a blog entry of between 1500-2500 words at the end of the course on your website and design a vignette to illustrate the (some) following questions (feel free to replace them by more meaningful ones to you): How design can reconfigure systems of extraction?

For the first video iteration I learned to make reels on my cellphone with the help of Wen and found that it is a powerful communication tool. I chose a vertical mobile format since it highlighted the upper and lower parts (ceilings and floors). For the second iteration I added sounds I had captured on my personal Zoom recorder of the local people we had spoken to to add a human element to the non-human footage.

When we take the time to look up and down, we open ourselves up to a whole new world of possibilities and perspectives.

It can be simple and unadorned, or it can be a work of art in its own right. By looking up, we can appreciate the beauty and creativity that goes into the design of these spaces. On the other hand, the ground beneath our feet can be just as interesting and inspiring. We walk on it every day without really noticing it, but there is so much beauty to be found in the textures and patterns of the ground. Whether it\u2019s the smooth marble of a city sidewalk or the rough stones of a natural pathway, the ground can be a canvas for artistic expression as well. As we move through our daily lives, we rarely take the time to appreciate the spaces above and below us. But by doing so, we gain a new perspective on the world around us.

Let us explore the textures and patterns of the ground beneath our feet and the artistic expression of the ceilings above us. By doing so, we open ourselves up to a whole new world of possibilities and perspectives.","title":"Video - \u201cComo es arriba, es abajo\u201d"},{"location":"term2/09-El%20Hierro%20Research%20Trip/#first-draft-video","text":"For this first draft, I chose to explore the concept in reel format.","title":"First draft video"},{"location":"term2/09-El%20Hierro%20Research%20Trip/#final-video","text":"For the final video I chose to have two horizontal strips showing the up and down of each geographical setting we explored during our visit to El Hierro.

The reason is because I feel there is still a design opportunity to figure out how the Perception board would work in context with children 13 years and older while also incorporating other elements to our system and session such as the Speaker Mic. We are also interested in designing a promotional landing site to pitch the project to other organisations that might be interested in collaborating with us. I feel I could also link it to the theme of gender equality by designing a session fully focused on that subject and then testing with a different community. In parallel, I would also like to work with Carolina to explore ecofeminism from a different angle. This is our first draft of the workshop we are planning to run with students as part of MDEFest. First draft here Our next steps will be to co-create design sessions with Fab Lab team working with K-12 schools and school teachers. We are also working on wrapping up and documenting our process to scale the project and pitch to competitions. Figma Landing site Ways of drifting - Scalability roadmap \u00b6 Jana and Roger made a recap of the \u201cWays of drifting\u201d that were presented during the second week of the Masters. The content resonated with me, in particular the Expansive approach to drifting which I feel has been the way I have been evolving my design practice during MDEF. Interventions and way of drifting: Innerbot - Comparative: Me and Wen found common areas and ways to apply chat GPT4 to help with mental health and IPV healing. Imagining futures with children - Comparative: We also approached this design intervention trying to find commonalities between climate change, gender equality and mental health and finding intersections through futures literacy. Ecofeminism - Probing: Me and Carolina tried to use arts and crafts as a means to begin conversations around ecofeminism and futures literacy with migrant women. Perception Board workshop with children - Serial: We tried to do a second iteration that builds on the learnings from the initial collage creation workshop and deep dive more on the topic areas we have chosen as a group with Ariel and Wen. Scalability roadmap Create a distributed network of educators and innovators working at the intersection of design, maker culture, fab labs and integrating design technology into classrooms. With Ariel and Wen we plan on launching this initiative with other MDEF alumni that have also collaborated with schools. We plan to map opportunity areas (such as a repository of schools to collaborate with, open source databases of workshops and tools). This relates to my initial interest in gender equality since using new tools can be triggers to having new conversations and discussions. Working with children is also a prevention and care approach to approaching the issue while helping frame conversations. Ecofeminism \u00b6 Sharing back Collage Intervention with Mam\u00e1s que Leen \u00b6 One of my priorities for this trimester is to share back with a larger community the work related on ecofeminism that I explored during the Second Trimester. For this reason, I partnered with Carolina to co-create a Medium Publication called Intersectional Tomorrows where we will share reflections and thougths related to our process and results of the intervention. Initially we found ourselves overwhelmed by what to communicate and on what platform but we then decided to start small with one blog post on Medium. Medium Article \u00b6 Me and Carolina quickly worked on writing a Medium article. We found the task to be quite easy since we had already documented our learnings for Design Studio purposes. We focused on channeling the depth of the insights we gained as a result of working closely with Mam\u00e1s que Leen. You can read the article here Perception Board - Futures Literacy in children \u00b6 Intervention 1 - Co-creation session with Future Learning at Fab Lab (Xavi) \u00b6 We did a one hour co-creation session with Xavi to refine our intervention with children. Some learnings that emerged from the conversation. We will carry out the activity with 15 year old children (3er grado) We will apply the intervention with the same school in Badalona (to ensure a baseline of same conditions) We will try to do some A/B testing between sessions (i.e. one facilitated entirely by us and one facilitated by the teacher with us not involved) We will also use papers instead of bringing the actual wooden board and work with groups of 4-5 students. We will then do a collective shareback. We will facilitate a voting session on Menti so students can have a say in what topic is discussed. After the session we emailed the director of the school hoping we can schedule a session during May or early June. As a group, we are also planning on hosting a Zoom session with MDEF alumni that have also worked with schools, bringing all of us together to share experiences and also officially launch our tools to map perceptions and design futures collaboratively with children. As next steps, we are gathering the emails of the students and defining the theme of the conversation during the MDEFest sessions. Intervention 2 - Async planning with teachers from Sant Andreu School in Badalona \u00b6 Ariel contacted Merce, the school director, to coordinate having a session with 3 rd grade students during June. Merce offered us a one hour slot during June 8 th for 90 students. This has brought the following design constraints: Because of the large quantity, we might need to divide ourselves up or just run a super quick exercise with each of the 3 classes. We can do a train the trainers program for teachers to see if they want to implement in their own schedules. This was Xavi\u2019s suggestion. Unfortunately the school does not have other time slots to offer because of the dates and reaching out to a new school is not a possibility at this stage. Our challenge right now is to iterate the workshop to fit the new constraints. Prototyping for Design Challenge week \u00b6 During this week we focused on building a digital interface where children could map their invented futures and pick one out of two Dall-E generated images to feed an interactive gallery. In parallel, we also iterated our workshop with children looking at the design constraints of working with 90 children. Some alternatives we have explored. Having a one-hour session in one same big space and dividing them all into smaller groups + relying on teachers for facilitation. Iterate our session to a quick product demo and go into each classroom for quick 20 minutes slots to gather their opinions and feedback. Overall, we want to loosen control of the workshop and see what emerges of just bringing the product and choosing a specific topic to discuss such as climate change and deforestation.","title":"Design studio"},{"location":"term3/01-Design%20studio/#design-studio","text":"","title":"Design Studio"},{"location":"term3/01-Design%20studio/#outlining-my-first-intervention-for-the-third-trimester","text":"For this third trimester I would like to focus on the Perception Board workshop I have been working with Ariel and Wen, while in parallel running small experiments.

Day 1 - Mushroom model \u00b6 During the first three hour seminar we learned about the updated Mushroom model, a framework that allows designers to understand interconnections between value, knowledge, power and making. My group chose Chat GPT-4 as a product to analyze using this framework. It was interesting to see how other groups opted for products or objects such as hair clips and bread which were very different in nature. Starting with such a complex product from the start allowed us to have an orderly understanding of the potential impact chat GPT-4 can have not only on users but also to begin to comprehend the power structures that exist in the use of this product. An interesting point that arose in the conversation is how investors and tech leaders are asking for a six month hold on the development of this technology to begin to understand its impact since it is a technology that is rapidly evolving with little understanding of how it can impact industries or even the education sector. Learning Skils Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? During the activity I focused on developing soft skills such as active listening and also documenting everyone\u2019s ideas while brainstorming was taking place. For the future, I would love to use the mushroom model at the start of any project or product idea as a team. It is good for collaboration and getting everyone to think about impact. To me, something new was separating power from money and from knowledge and starting to look at those dimensions separately to get a better sense of who is benefiting from a system and who might be left behind or even being taken advantage of (even if unintentionally). Dynamics How was the dynamic inside the group? The discussion within the group was quite interesting and it was amazing that everyone felt comfortable bringing in their own perspective. As a group, we agreed that we had picked a challenging prompt as an initial idea but it also led to some discussions that were interesting for all of us. We also learned new fun facts about Chat GPT like the broad list of competitors in the market. Interactions Did the role I played influence my opinion? In this exercise I played the role of jotting down everyone\u2019s opinion. Being the one taking notes helped me prioritize and synthesize our groups ideas quite fast. For me one takeaway that I now have in regards to chat GPT is how it could eventually displace Google and understanding monopolies in search engines and now AI chatbots. Day 2 - Reflection tree \u00b6 During this second session we looked at impact with more nuance and complexity, starting to understand why it is necessary in the first place and also broadening our definition of what impact can look like. It was interesting to consider diverse angles, some more social (human) and others more related to sustainability and incorporating non-human actors. Learning Skils Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? I think it was interesting to sit down and self evaluate our projects in all of these dimensions. The specific questions within each category were particularly useful to understand what blind spots we might be having and to also gain more clarity in regards to which aspect we are currently prioritizing and which other aspects we might need to prioritize later. For instance, in the case of my project with Wen and Ariel we are working a lot to shift children\u2019s perceptions but we might need to work on making the actual product more regenerative using recyclable materials or creating repair guides. Dynamics How was the dynamic inside the group? Me, Ariel and Wen were very aligned during our self evaluation and doing the initial activity as a group allowed us to look at opportunity areas we hadn\u2019t thought of for our intervention during this trimester. We will see ways to include repair manuals and more eco-friendly materials during the last Fab Lab challenge week. Interactions Did the role I played influence my opinion? Yes, I think also contrasting my viewpoint with Marc, who is working with ceramics, helped us have an external viewpoint from someone who is not in the day to day of our Perception Board Project. This was particularly useful since he made a good pushback to evaluate how we can \u201cwalk our talk\u201d, using ecology-based principles even in the product we are making children interact with. Day 3- Values \u00b6 This final seminar of Distributed Design we made some time to philosophize on specific values we wanted to prioritize. I chose to focus on \u201cJustice\u201d as I was particularly interested in how it is a complex value that seeks to balance accountability with forgiveness and also poses interesting questions around repair, reparations and compensations. I chose this value also because I feel it is important when working with gender-based violence to also find ways to assist survivors and seek some form of justice (if such concept even exists). Learning Skils Which skills did I need during the activity and how can I translate into something useful for me and my future? During the activity my group focused on having a meditative conversation, allowing ourselves to express how we feel and real life examples when we felt we were being treated in an unjust way. We interacted with magazine cut outs, glue and colored pencils. Dynamics How was the dynamic inside the group? It was interesting since Amanda brought magazines to make a collage cut out. We decided to let our creativity flow and use colored pencils and also write words down. It felt like a therapy session and I personally feel it made more sense to approach the value in this unstructured way rather than using a Powerpoint presentation. Interactions Did the role I played influence my opinion? I think proposing the value was great because I found that Carolina, Amanda, Wen and Sami were also interested in it. Paige posed an interesting question which is if nature has justice in itself or if it is only a human value and has no space in the natural world. I am still thinking of the question and don\u2019t have any answers yet. However, it made me think of divine justice and how some people and religions associate natural disasters with divine justice and even punishment.","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20Design/#distributed-design","text":"This week we were exposed to Distributed Design, a fresh take on how to measure impact from different aspects taking into account social, ecosystem and regenerative viewpoints.","title":"Distributed Design"},{"location":"term3/02-Distributed%20Design/#day-1-mushroom-model","text":"During the first three hour seminar we learned about the updated Mushroom model, a framework that allows designers to understand interconnections between value, knowledge, power and making.

I was sick for this session but looking through the class documentation what stood out for me was exploring all the possibilities related to the use of this technology and how robots can be used for many different purposes. I also played around with the Rhino plug in to see the simulation of the robotic arm. It was interesting to see how the joints indicate the type of movement the robot makes and my understanding of types of movements by robots is now expanded. I also learned that Rhino and Grasshopper are tools that help simulate how specific robots (like robotic arms) can move. I prepped a Rhino file with a group from the class using Grasshopper using the plug ins that are found in the class documentation. One of the questions this module sparked for me was how can we introduce robots to solutions to human problems beyond engineering and manufacturing? I know robots help with assembly line of manufacturing, such as cutting wood. Day 2 - Introduction to Blender \u00b6 During this session Victor introduced us to the software of Blender. I had previously used Blender for a prototyping for design challenge but was unaware of many of its benefits and also did not know that it is open source. We were introduced in depth to its history, the concept of software libre and open and how the product has evolved in the past years. I was also surprised to learn that Blender can also be used with Python and shares similarities with coding. As Blender is a tool focused on animation it is not necessarily the right tool always. However, Victor showed how he used Blender applied to Romi, a project focused on the south of France and north of Spain using tools for farmer hackers. This real-life example helped contextualize the tool to design settings. As such, the class underscored how knowing and using tools like Blender can be a valuable asset for designers in their work. Day 3 - Live coding as a human interface \u00b6 During this class, Xavi shared his background and how he became part of the Future Learning stream at the Fab Lab. To me it was very interesting to learn about his background, having collaborated with him previously to get in contact with primary schools in Badalona. We were then introduced to the work of Citlali Hernandez. She shared her work using Fab Lab tools to create wearable electronics merging conceptual art. Blending choreography and dancing with electronics and how she has showcased her work in cities such as Valencia and in Santiago de Chile. Some questions raised where the body as complexity and what is the body? It was also interesting to see how she incorporated the Raspberry pi to her own body of work. We also played around with Hydra ( https://hydra.ojack.xyz/ ) changing the shapes to play around with circles and oscilloscopes. Hydra is a livecoding video synth that works on the browser. It is open source and works for both beginners and experts. Day 4 - Blender as interface \u00b6 During this session Victor showed us integrations of Python and Blender. The one that stood out for me the most was using the cell phone\u2019s sensors to make the Blender image move as the cell phone is also rotated and moved. I did not know these types of syncs were possible using Blender and Python and gave me curiosity to explore more, especially since I\u2019m interested in learning how to model on Blender animations and renders that can be used for product design and pitching product ideas. The class was spent trying to control LED strips using a combination of Blender and Arduino. Code to receive data: if len(message.split(b\u2019,\u2019)) == 17: x = float(message.split(b\u2019,\u2019)[-2]) * 0.01745 y = float(message.split(b\u2019,\u2019)[-1]) * 0.01745 z = float(message.split(b\u2019,\u2019)[-3]) * 0.01745 # print(x,y,z) context.object.rotation_euler.x = x context.object.rotation_euler.y = y context.object.rotation_euler.z = z Challenge Week Term III - Digital Prototyping for Design \u00b6 For this week, me, Wen and Ariel were planning to push forward the creation of AI-generated imagery using the children\u2019s imagined futures as inputs. We want to also focus on outlining the systems design of integrating digital artifacts to be handled by students during the implementation of our Perception Board. This was the challenge where we had the least clarity of what we wanted our output to be. This affected our planning the first day but we later figured out ways to embrace the ambiguity of the process. One strategic action we took during this week was to prioritize and choose the most complicated task first and invest most of our time on figuring how to set up the text-to-image web app. The result was a Web app that allows children to input their futures, generate 2 images that they can choose from and then generate a gallery or repository of all the compiled futures. My role during the week was to prototype with different ways to make the web app work and focus on documenting and prepping all the assets required for the intervention with the schools. Ariel was in charge of coding the product and Wen in charge of facilitating and solving bugs in the code. We were very time efficient and tried to focus on being very intentional with the digital interface we were building. Feedback received during challenge week As we had a functioning product, we had very useful feedback related to the ethical implications of using Dall-E with children and how that can affect our own learning outcomes. What stood out for me the most was how our collage creation exercise is actually analog to how algorithms are created with specific inputs. In that sense, introducing the Digital interface of creation of futures can be used, having a conversation around the ethical implications of AI with children. How the project links to my research project (Design studio) This digital interface relates to my research project since my initial hypothesis was to work at the service of children\u2019s visions regarding equality. If we conduct a session focused more on inclusion and gender equality, I could use the digital interface to visualize their own futures in regards to these subjects.

I know robots help with assembly line of manufacturing, such as cutting wood.","title":"Day 1 - Robots"},{"location":"term3/03-Prototyping%20For%20Design/#day-2-introduction-to-blender","text":"During this session Victor introduced us to the software of Blender. I had previously used Blender for a prototyping for design challenge but was unaware of many of its benefits and also did not know that it is open source. We were introduced in depth to its history, the concept of software libre and open and how the product has evolved in the past years. I was also surprised to learn that Blender can also be used with Python and shares similarities with coding. As Blender is a tool focused on animation it is not necessarily the right tool always. However, Victor showed how he used Blender applied to Romi, a project focused on the south of France and north of Spain using tools for farmer hackers. This real-life example helped contextualize the tool to design settings. As such, the class underscored how knowing and using tools like Blender can be a valuable asset for designers in their work.","title":"Day 2 - Introduction to Blender"},{"location":"term3/03-Prototyping%20For%20Design/#day-3-live-coding-as-a-human-interface","text":"During this class, Xavi shared his background and how he became part of the Future Learning stream at the Fab Lab.

We were then introduced to the work of Citlali Hernandez. She shared her work using Fab Lab tools to create wearable electronics merging conceptual art. Blending choreography and dancing with electronics and how she has showcased her work in cities such as Valencia and in Santiago de Chile. Some questions raised where the body as complexity and what is the body? It was also interesting to see how she incorporated the Raspberry pi to her own body of work. We also played around with Hydra ( https://hydra.ojack.xyz/ ) changing the shapes to play around with circles and oscilloscopes. Hydra is a livecoding video synth that works on the browser.

I did not know these types of syncs were possible using Blender and Python and gave me curiosity to explore more, especially since I\u2019m interested in learning how to model on Blender animations and renders that can be used for product design and pitching product ideas.

We want to also focus on outlining the systems design of integrating digital artifacts to be handled by students during the implementation of our Perception Board. This was the challenge where we had the least clarity of what we wanted our output to be. This affected our planning the first day but we later figured out ways to embrace the ambiguity of the process. One strategic action we took during this week was to prioritize and choose the most complicated task first and invest most of our time on figuring how to set up the text-to-image web app. The result was a Web app that allows children to input their futures, generate 2 images that they can choose from and then generate a gallery or repository of all the compiled futures. My role during the week was to prototype with different ways to make the web app work and focus on documenting and prepping all the assets required for the intervention with the schools. Ariel was in charge of coding the product and Wen in charge of facilitating and solving bugs in the code. We were very time efficient and tried to focus on being very intentional with the digital interface we were building. Feedback received during challenge week As we had a functioning product, we had very useful feedback related to the ethical implications of using Dall-E with children and how that can affect our own learning outcomes. What stood out for me the most was how our collage creation exercise is actually analog to how algorithms are created with specific inputs. In that sense, introducing the Digital interface of creation of futures can be used, having a conversation around the ethical implications of AI with children. How the project links to my research project (Design studio) This digital interface relates to my research project since my initial hypothesis was to work at the service of children\u2019s visions regarding equality. If we conduct a session focused more on inclusion and gender equality, I could use the digital interface to visualize their own futures in regards to these subjects.

Ariel highlighted how technology has become an inherent part of our existence and how it is not neutral but carries underlying values and ethics. The idea of \u201cdesign is ethics by other means\u201d was introduced, emphasizing how design choices can reflect the ethical values of those who create them. The concept of the iceberg model was also discussed, which suggests that what we see on the surface is only a small part of a larger system, and that there are underlying layers that relate to different things. Overall, this class emphasized the importance of understanding the assumptions and values that underlie the technology we use, and the ethical implications of design choices in our increasingly technological world. In this class, we explored the idea of technological neutrality and how it can be a reductive way of looking at technology. For instance, the saying \u201cgames don\u2019t kill people, people kill people\u201d oversimplifies the complex role that technology can play in shaping our behavior and experiences. We discussed how even something as seemingly neutral as a gun can have a profound impact on the situation and the people involved. When someone holds a gun, they become a hybrid of sorts, a person with a weapon that defines what is possible within the situation. This discussion challenged us to think more critically about the role of technology in our lives and the ethical implications of our design choices. We also explored the values and assumptions that are inscribed in our designs and how they can shape the products we create with the example of the product that cradles newborn babies. We discussed the importance of promoting care and support for families, rather than relying solely on techno-solutionism as the norm. We also delved into the negative consequences that can arise from designing for simplicity and convenience, rather than considering the complexity of the issue at hand. Overall, this class challenged us to think more critically about the values we want to promote in our designs and how we can mitigate tensions that arise as a result. Day 2 - Types of Design Ethics \u00b6 John Culkin, \u201cWe become what we behold. We shape our tools and then our tools shape us.\u201d The overarching theme of the class was to avoid exploiting others and to find ways to align ethical principles with technological and design advancements. One philosopher, Gudnyas, from Uruguay, recognized the importance of feminist critical theory and environmentalism in shaping ethical principles. This aligns with Donna Haraway\u2019s idea of bringing together diverse perspectives to address complex issues. This was especially relevant to my work trying to push gender justice through design interventions. Similarly, in the context of AI, an open letter was discussed, calling for a pause on giant AI experiments, and the dangers of eugenics and scientific racism were explored. Another important takeaway for me was looking at AI technology and how it perpetuates racism and bias even as an uninteded consequence. The class also discussed how design can be used to promote key human goods. Victor Papanek\u2019s book \u201cDesign for the Real World\u201d emphasizes how everyone designs in their everyday lives. However, the profession of design is often seen as exclusive, and the class questioned what the key human good of design is. Mariana Mazucatto\u2019s perspective on the business value of design was explored, along with the concept of design justice by Sasha Constanza-Chock. We were also introduced to the notion of care applied to design, looking at examples like Lekshmy Parameswaran from The Care Lab. We also looked at dark patterns in UI design (i.e. shaming user for not choosing a specific option) and how this affects the ethics of the design process itself. Ultimately, the class emphasized the importance of deep thought and intention in all aspects of life, including design and technological advancements. The goal is to move towards a more preferred state, where ethical principles are aligned with advancements in technology and design. My biggest takeaway of this class was mentioned at the end when Ariel made us question: What is design\u2019s purpose? It is unclear when you compare to medicine or law and other professions that have more clarity of their goal and purpose.","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"term3/05-Design%20Ethics/#design-ethics","text":"","title":"Design Ethics"},{"location":"term3/05-Design%20Ethics/#day-1-intro","text":"In this class, Ariel discussed various topics related to naturalism, technology, design, and systems thinking.

The discussion explored the concept of eugenics and how it has been used to justify terrible acts in the name of moral duty. The use of men to refer to humankind and the British Eugenics Society were also touched upon. Julian Huxley, a biologist and one of the most important thinkers of the British Eugenics Society, promoted the idea of enhancing the human race through genetics. However, eugenics policies were used to sterilize women from ethnic minorities without consent and even with consent, state forces convinced women in precarious situations why they wouldn\u2019t be good mothers. This resonated with me personally because in Peru during Alberto Fujimori\u2019s regime many indigenous women were sterilized without their consent and this practice is still justified by large parts of the Peruvian population. The class also delved into the importance of paying attention to the use of terms, terminology, narrative, and discourses. Spinoza\u2019s philosophy, which distinguishes power as negative, restrictive, and oppressive (potestas) from power as positive, affirmative, and empowering (potentia), was also discussed. The idea that politics cannot be split from ethics and epistemology was also highlighted. The discussion then shifted to the topic of Indigenous feminism and radical Indigenous survivance and empowerment, which counter creating narratives that reproduce colonial background. The importance of being aware of one\u2019s own privileges was emphasized, and Daniela Ortiz\u2019s critical approach to migrant laws in Spain and the Spanish State was discussed. Ius Sanguinis, which is still present in Spain, was also touched upon, and it was pointed out how systemic racism, colonialism, and extreme inequalities are still present in our structures. The class also explored the concept of the subaltern, which refers to the experience and subjective condition of the subordinate, determined by a relation of domination, and the idea that \u201cwe cannot demolish the master\u2019s house with the master\u2019s tools\u201d. Epistemic violence was discussed, and it was pointed out that it is important to pay attention to absences as well as presences. The class concluded by emphasizing the importance of being aware of one\u2019s own privileges and contradictions, using tools from Western philosophy to open up critical cracks on what topics to address, and acknowledging who occupies the place of enunciation. The discussion also explored bioethics and biohacking within a queer perspective, emphasizing that there are no universal rules or methodologies. Mary Magic\u2019s idea of synthesizing hormones for queer bodies raises important questions about control and ownership of our bodies, particularly in the context of colonization and bioethics. She proposes that open source hormones could be developed as an alternative to biomedically-produced hormones, which have been shown to contain xenoestrogens that disrupt hormonal balance. Overall, Mary Magic\u2019s proposal opens up important conversations about control, ownership, and autonomy over our own bodies, particularly in the context of colonization and queer bodies. It challenges us to rethink dominant medical narratives and to consider alternative ways of taking care of ourselves and our bodies. Day 2 - Looking at projects hacking the binary and concepts of pureness \u00b6 During this seminar, we delved into several exciting projects and references that challenged my thinking on various topics. One of the most inspiring projects we looked at was the work of Quimera Rosa and their experimental wet lab in Barcelona. They experiment on themselves and their work is based on the principle of consent and dissent. Their approach gave me a new perspective on accessibility and the possibility of being in touch with other communities and perspectives. Another reference that resonated with me was Lynn Margulis\u2019 book \u201cSymbiotic Planet,\u201d which challenged the conventional social neo-darwinist conception of evolution based on struggle. Instead, Margulis proposed the concept of symbiotic interdependence, which can lead to a more harmonious co-existence. This concept reinforced the importance of interconnections and the need to work towards collective care practices. We also looked at the Aquaforensics project by Robertina \u0160ebjani\u010d and Gjino \u0160uti\u0107, which explored the impact of sound pollution on ocean dwellers. This project pushed the boundaries of where design practice and philosophy start and end and highlighted the need to address privilege, gender roles, and citizenship in our approach to sustainability. Finally, we explored the concept of Design Justice, which emphasizes the need for designers to be more accountable and responsible for their work. The Myconnect project was an example of this approach, where a post-human interconnected planetary perspective was taken to view everything as co-habitants of the planet, rather than resources for exploitation. Overall, these projects and references challenged my thinking on power dynamics, the illusion of purity, and the importance of collective care. They also emphasized the need for situated epistemologies and the importance of addressing toxic and pure concepts to create a more equitable society. Storytelling as a non-extractive research method As I sit with his stories, I value how storytelling can be a caring way for researchers and participants to collaborate as equal partners. I further wonder, isn\u2019t it ironic to refer to some people as\u2018participants\u2019 and some as \u2018researchers\u2019 when there\u2019s a deep two-way exchange of energy and wisdom?","title":"Critical Transfeminist Design"},{"location":"term3/06-Critical%20Transfeminist%20Design/#critical-transfeminist-design","text":"","title":"Critical Transfeminist Design"},{"location":"term3/06-Critical%20Transfeminist%20Design/#day-1-intro","text":"\u201cEn un mundo donde el lenguaje y el nombrar las cosas son poder\u2026 el silencio es opresi\u00f3n y violencia.\u201d Adrienne Rich The importance of acknowledging the colonial background and systemic racism in our structures was a central theme in this seminar.

I further wonder, isn\u2019t it ironic to refer to some people as\u2018participants\u2019 and some as \u2018researchers\u2019 when there\u2019s a deep two-way exchange of energy and wisdom?","title":"Day 2 - Looking at projects hacking the binary and concepts of pureness"},{"location":"term3/07-Collective%20Intelligence/","text":"Decentralized Autonomous Organizations \u00b6 First Session with Guillem \u00b6 In a recent session of my MDEF tech track, we delved into the world of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and explored various technologies and design approaches that can help us build sustainable, regenerative, and expressive futures. One key insight that emerged from the session was the idea that protocols and platforms are not just engineering artifacts, but rather social constructs that enable us to communicate and collaborate with each other. Whether it\u2019s a digital protocol like JPEG or HTML, or a platform like Instagram or WhatsApp, these tools shape the way we interact and make decisions. To apply these ideas to our own intervention projects, we were asked to choose a digital protocol or platform that we plan to use and reflect on its strengths and limitations in terms of enabling participation, transparency, and inclusivity. In addition to exploring these practical aspects of technology design, we also delved into some deeper philosophical and ethical questions. For instance, we discussed the concept of \u201cdecolonizing technologies\u201d and how we can move from extractive and convenience-focused technologies to regenerative, expressive, and rebel technologies that prioritize sustainability and social justice. We also explored some fascinating case studies, such as the Critical Engineering Manifesto, which challenges us to question the dominant narratives and power structures that shape our technology landscape, and the provocative question of how to host a website for 500 years, which highlights the ephemeral nature of our digital infrastructure and the need for more sustainable alternatives. Overall, the session helped us see technology not as a mystical or magical force, but as a tangible and material reality that is deeply intertwined with social, political, and environmental issues. By understanding the inner workings of digital protocols and platforms, and by adopting a more critical and reflective stance towards technology, we can begin to design and build more sustainable and equitable futures. We then did an exercise of reverse engineering our digital lives, understanding the complexity of physical wires, servers and networks involved in something as routine as sending a message via Whatsapp. Session 1 with Mar Canet \u00b6 In a recent class, we explored the intersection of AI, art, and media technology, particularly in relation to NFTs. The session was led by Mar Canet, who shared his insights on AI-aided ceramic sculptures and their potential for bridging deep learning with materiality. One of the highlights of the session was the discussion on NFTs and how they are transforming the art world. We learned about an NFT shop located in an abandoned gas station, which sells video performances created using artist-made Snapchat filters as NFTs. We then delved into the world of cryptocurrency, specifically Ethereum and its predecessor, Cryptokitties. We learned about the role of miners in blockchain infrastructure and how Ethereum funded Cryptokitties to slow down their operations. Mar also explained the different types of blockchain wallets, including hardware and cold wallets, and how they are essential for securely storing cryptocurrencies. We discussed the various types of tokens, including fungible, semi-fungible, and non-fungible tokens. Mar highlighted the importance of understanding the technology behind NFTs and how it enables the creation of unique, one-of-a-kind digital assets. Session 2 with Mar Canet \u00b6 We created our own wallets using Temple Wallet and learned about IPFS as a good place to store our digital assets. Overall, the session was eye-opening and highlighted the importance of understanding the underlying technology behind NFTs and cryptocurrency in general.

These organizations utilize blockchain technology to enforce rules and protocols in a transparent and autonomous manner. What fascinated me the most was the idea that DAOs enable millions of dollars to be invested in art through collective decision-making processes. During the seminar, we were introduced to an intriguing example of a decentralized autonomous artist called Botto, whose works of art are created based on feedback from the community. Another highlight of the seminar was the discussion on the concept of latent space. Latent space refers to hidden or emerging aspects that cannot be directly studied in any field. Additionally, we discussed Jonas Lund, an artist who has incorporated DAOs into his work. Lund\u2019s chatbot, \u201cTalk with Jonas Lund,\u201d sparked interesting conversations about the intersection of AI and art. Overall, this final seminar with Mar Canet left a lasting impression on me. The concepts of DAOs, decentralized artists, latent space, and the integration of AI in art have broadened my understanding of the evolving relationship between technology and creativity.
